# Executing funded standard proposals can be prevented by a proposal slate with duplicate proposals

## Summary

Anyone can propose a slate of standard proposals to be funded in a distribution period with the `StandardFunding.checkSlate` function. The proposal slate can contain duplicate proposal ids, which, if the slate is the top slate, can be used to prevent a standard proposal from being executed (funded).

## Vulnerability Detail

A funded standard proposal is executed by calling the `StandardFunding.executeStandard` function. A proposal is considered successfully funded if its state returned by the `GrantFund.state` function is `IGovernor.ProposalState.Succeeded`. This is the case if `StandardFunding._standardFundingVoteSucceeded` returns `true`.

`StandardFunding._standardFundingVoteSucceeded` checks if the given proposal id is included in the currently funded proposal slate.

However, as mentioned in the beginning, the proposal slate can contain duplicate proposal ids. A slate can therefore be maximized (in regard to the allocated budget) with the same proposal id. Worst case, this "malicious" slate can not be replaced with a correct slate, as the allocated budget of a correct slate can not exceed the allocated budget of the malicious slate.

In this case, the `StandardFunding.executeStandard` function will not execute the proposal, which is not included in the "malicious" proposal slate.

## Impact

Standard proposals can be prevented from being funded in a distribution period.

```solidity

199:     // check if Proposal is in the topTenProposals list
200:     if (_findProposalIndex(proposalIds_[i], topTenProposals[distributionId_]) == -1) return false;
201:
202:     Proposal memory proposal = standardFundingProposals[proposalIds_[i]];
203:
204:     // account for qvBudgetAllocated possibly being negative
205:     if (proposal.qvBudgetAllocated < 0) return false;
206:
207:     // update counters
208:     sum += uint256(proposal.qvBudgetAllocated);
209:     totalTokensRequested += proposal.tokensRequested;
210:
211:     // check if slate of proposals exceeded budget constraint ( 90% of GBC )
212:     if (totalTokensRequested > (gbc * 9 / 10)) {
213:         return false;
214:     }
215:
216:     unchecked {
217:         ++i;
218:     }
219: }

## Recommendation

Consider checking for duplicate proposal ids in the `checkSlate` function.
