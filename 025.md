# Inflator calculation is higher than interest rate initialized due to use of natural exponentiation

## Summary

The function `PoolCommons.accrueInterest`, used on every pool write interaction, calculates the inflator using `PRBMathUD60x18.exp`, which leads to a higher interest rate than expected.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `accrueInterest` function calculates the `newInflator` by multiplying `inflator` with the `pendingFactor = e^(rate_annual * elapsed_years)`. This is not the expected factor of `(1 + rate_annual)^elapsed_years`.

For example, a 5% annual rate means a factor of `1.05`, as it converts a debt of 100 to 105 after one year. Here, it is multiplying it by `e^0.05 = 1.05127`.

## Impact

The interest rate is higher than expected. Creating a pool with 5% interest rate will effectively use a 5.127% interest rate on borrowers.
