# Unbounded loop when creating NFT Subset Lending Pool can consume all gas and revert the transaction.

## Summary

Unbounded loop when creating NFT Subset Lending Pool can consume all gas and revert the transaction.

## Vulnerability Detail

When creating a NFT lending pool, the creator can choose to speific a subset of token id supported as collateral.

```solidity
function deployPool(
	address collateral_, address quote_, uint256[] memory tokenIds_, uint256 interestRate_
)
```

While the pool is created, a for loop runs to iterate over the tokenIds to set the tokenId state to true in the ERC721Pool.sol contract.

```solidity
bytes memory data = abi.encodePacked(
	PoolType.ERC721,
	ajna,
	collateral_,
	quote_,
	quoteTokenScale,
	tokenIds_.length,
	nftType
);

ERC721Pool pool = ERC721Pool(address(implementation).clone(data));

pool_ = address(pool);

// Track the newly deployed pool
deployedPools[getNFTSubsetHash(tokenIds_)][collateral_][quote_] = pool_;
deployedPoolsList.push(pool_);

emit PoolCreated(pool_);

pool.initialize(tokenIds_, interestRate_);
```

Which calls:

```solidity
/// @inheritdoc IERC721Pool
function initialize(
	uint256[] memory tokenIds_,
	uint256 rate_
) external override {
	if (isPoolInitialized) revert AlreadyInitialized();

	inflatorState.inflator       = uint208(1e18);
	inflatorState.inflatorUpdate = uint48(block.timestamp);

	interestState.interestRate       = uint208(rate_);
	interestState.interestRateUpdate = uint48(block.timestamp);

	uint256 noOfTokens = tokenIds_.length;

	if (noOfTokens != 0) {
		// add subset of tokenIds allowed in the pool
		for (uint256 id = 0; id < noOfTokens;) {
			tokenIdsAllowed[tokenIds_[id]] = true;

			unchecked { ++id; }
		}
	}

	Loans.init(loans);

	// increment initializations count to ensure these values can't be updated
	isPoolInitialized = true;
}
```

note the for loop:

```solidity
if (noOfTokens != 0) {
	// add subset of tokenIds allowed in the pool
	for (uint256 id = 0; id < noOfTokens;) {
		tokenIdsAllowed[tokenIds_[id]] = true;

		unchecked { ++id; }
	}
}
```

This for loop has no upper boundary, and this unbounded loop when creating NFT Subset Lending Pool can consume all gas and revert the transaction.

## Impact

It is very common a NFT collection 10000 items or even more, if the pool creator wants to create a pool that support a subset of the collateral, for example, 5000 items, the for loop have to run 5000 times, if the creator wants to support 8000 items, for loop run 5000 times, which is very gas consuming. The creator may not aware that he has to pay this large amount of gas to create a pool and lose a gas fee.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

We recommend the protocol use merkle tree root to whitelist the NFT token id instead of running for loop and set the token id state to true on-chain.
