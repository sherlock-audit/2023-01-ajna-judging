# Interest rates can be raised above the market as a griefing, disabling the pool

## Summary

Interest rates algorithm is based on `MAU` to `TAU` dynamics, where TAU is 3.5 day EMA of total debt to LUP * total collateral. The latter value can be manipulated by a big collateral holder by becoming a borrower with insignificant debt and lots of collateral, so 3.5d EMA of `Debt / (LUP * Collateral)` will become depressed and rates will go up irrespective to the real debt supply/demand situation.

## Vulnerability Detail

Let's suppose Bob is a big WBTC holder and current market rate for its lending is insignificant, say base WBTC deposit APY on major platforms is below 5 basis points. Say Bob is a big lender of USDC-WBTC (quote-collateral) pool or Bob has interests in disturbing that pool operations for any reasons, for example Bob is a beneficiary of a rival lending protocol.

Bob can borrow a minimal loan, say `1000 USDC` with big, magnitudes excessive, WBTC collateral, say `1000 WBTC`. As the pool is permissionless it is safe, Bob can withdraw any time, market risk is close to zero as the loan is too small, interest rates risk is small too as Bob left near zero market interest rate for the strict zero income while the WBTC is used as collateral in the pool. I.e. it's low risk, low cost strategy for Bob to do so.

Pool, on the other hand, will experience gradual rise of the interest rate as while `MAU` will stay relatively constant, `TAU` will become low due to total collateral amount being big (and stable, so EMA will move to the corresponding value), while other parts of `Debt / (LUP * Collateral)` be relatively constant.

Observing the rise of interest rates above market the borrowers will gradually leave. But not all, and Bob has achieved above market interest income from dormant part of the borrowers, who are slow to react to this dynamics. But, given borrowers being mostly rational and informed, this to be relatively short-term situation. More importantly, as the rate went up and borrowers has left, lenders will observe significantly decreased utilization and will leave pool as well, not receiving enough interest income for their deposits.

This way Bob essentially disturbed the USDC-WBTC pool, so he can leave some small part of WBTC collateral there so that the rate will stay elevated and pool remain to be unusable due to significantly elevated interest rate, as no borrower will enter there on such conditions.

## Impact

Pool utility for market participants can be destroyed by manipulating the interest rate algorithm, so such pool becomes unusable and end up being abandoned. Since for a pair of quote-collateral there can be only one pool this effectively disturb the whole line of business, i.e. profit from say USDC quote, WBTC collateral operations will cease to exist for Ajna token holders.

Current borrowers can experience losses from the manipulated above market interest rate. Dormant borrowers, i.e. ones who be slow to react, will be hit the hardest.

Attack cost is proportional to the current risk-free market interest rate of the collateral as attacker gives it up for a while. This can be low enough for the majority of widely utilized collateral assets.

## Code Snippet

Target utilization TAU is computed from average collateralization ratio, `Debt / Collateral`:

            interestParams_.interestRate       = uint208(newInterestRate);
            interestParams_.interestRateUpdate = uint48(block.timestamp);

_updateInterestState() and _accruePoolInterest() are called within all state changing operations of the pool:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-ajna/blob/main/contracts/src/base/Pool.sol#L481-L488

```solidity
    function _updateInterestState(
        PoolState memory poolState_,
        uint256 lup_
    ) internal {
        // if it has been more than 12 hours since the last interest rate update, call updateInterestRate function
        if (block.timestamp - interestState.interestRateUpdate > 12 hours) {
            PoolCommons.updateInterestRate(interestState, deposits, poolState_, lup_);
        }
```

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-ajna/blob/main/contracts/src/base/Pool.sol#L426-L431

```solidity
    function _accruePoolInterest() internal returns (PoolState memory poolState_) {
        // retrieve t0Debt amount from poolBalances struct
        uint256 t0Debt = poolBalances.t0Debt;

        // initialize fields of poolState_ struct with initial values
        poolState_.collateral     = poolBalances.pledgedCollateral;
```

Pool collateral is updated on any borrowing:

```solidity
    function drawDebt(
        AuctionsState storage auctions_,
        mapping(uint256 => Bucket) storage buckets_,
        DepositsState storage deposits_,
        LoansState    storage loans_,
        PoolState calldata poolState_,
        address borrowerAddress_,
        uint256 amountToBorrow_,
        uint256 limitIndex_,
        uint256 collateralToPledge_
    ) external returns (
        DrawDebtResult memory result_
    ) {
        Borrower memory borrower = loans_.borrowers[borrowerAddress_];

        result_.poolDebt       = poolState_.debt;
        result_.newLup         = _lup(deposits_, result_.poolDebt);
        result_.poolCollateral = poolState_.collateral;

        ...

        // pledge collateral to pool
        if (collateralToPledge_ != 0) {
            // add new amount of collateral to pledge to borrower balance
            borrower.collateral  += collateralToPledge_;

            ...

            // add new amount of collateral to pledge to pool balance
            result_.poolCollateral += collateralToPledge_;
        }
```

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Per discussions so far the most effective approach, proposed by Matt, looks to be the weighting the collateral with the corresponding debt, i.e. instead of computing `sum(D_i) / sum(C_i)` (we omit `1 / LUP` term as it's constant here), which is the average collateralization ratio, the debt weighted version of it can be used, `sum(D_i ^ 2) / sum(C_i * D_i)`, which is the average collateralization ratio weighted by current debt.

As obtaining any significant debt brings in both market and interest rate risk, i.e. will raise the probability of attacker's borrow position liquidation and also ends up paying the elevated interest rate proportionally to the debt acquired, it will substantially raise the cost and diminish practical probability of the attack.
