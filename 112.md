# Transfer deletes approval mapping

## Summary
The permit function sets the spender as an approved user in the _tokenApprovals mapping via the _approve function. When an NFT is transferred the _tokenApprovals mapping is deleted which removes the spenders' ability to move the NFT.

## Vulnerability Detail
When a customer calls the safeTransferFromWithPermit function the permit function runs eventually setting the spender as an authorized user via the _approve function. The function then runs safeTransferFrom which moves the NFT from the owner to the receiver. In the process of transferring, the approval mapping is deleted which means the spender no longer has the authorization to move the NFT. 

## Impact
Transferring the NFT removes the approval the NFT owner gave the spender.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-ajna/blob/main/contracts/src/base/PermitERC721.sol#L119
```solidity
    function safeTransferFromWithPermit(
        address from_, address to_, address spender_, uint256 tokenId_, uint256 deadline_, uint8 v_, bytes32 r_, bytes32 s_
    ) external {
        this.permit(spender_, tokenId_, deadline_, v_, r_, s_);
        safeTransferFrom(from_, to_, tokenId_);
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Transfer the NFT before calling the permit function. 
```solidity
    function safeTransferFromWithPermit(
        address from_, address to_, address spender_, uint256 tokenId_, uint256 deadline_, uint8 v_, bytes32 r_, bytes32 s_
    ) external {
        safeTransferFrom(from_, to_, tokenId_);
        this.permit(spender_, tokenId_, deadline_, v_, r_, s_);
    }
```
