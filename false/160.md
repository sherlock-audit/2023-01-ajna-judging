# transferLps(): we should assume allowance can be greater than actual transfer amount

## Summary

approveLpOwnership and transferLPs are used to transfer position to other address.
but in transferLPs(), it reverts when allowance is not exactly same as LP balance


## Vulnerability Detail


## Impact

_Users normally set allowance as infinite. Inconviniency in such basic function could result less protocol users in numbers_


## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-ajna/blob/main/contracts/src/libraries/external/LenderActions.sol#L500-L558

```solidity
uint256 transferAmount = allowances_[owner_][newOwner_][index];

Bucket storage bucket = buckets_[index];
Lender storage lender = bucket.lenders[owner_];

uint256 lenderDepositTime = lender.depositTime;

uint256 lenderLpBalance;

if (bucket.bankruptcyTime < lenderDepositTime) lenderLpBalance = lender.lps;

if (transferAmount == 0 || transferAmount != lenderLpBalance) revert NoAllowance();
```


## Tool used

Manual Review


## Recommendation

- if (transferAmount == 0 || transferAmount != lenderLpBalance) revert NoAllowance();
+ if (transferAmount < lenderLpBalance) revert NoAllowance();
