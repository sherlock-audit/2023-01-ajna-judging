# [M] Incorrect Validation in `Pool.sol#transferLPs` lead to a DOS attack

## Summary

The code in the transferLPs function has an incorrect validation check, where it requires `allowances_` to be strictly equal to `lenderLpBalance`, instead of just `allowances_` being greater than `transferAmount`.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the `transferLPs()` function, `transferAmount` is being compared to `allowances_[owner_][newOwner_][index]` and `lenderLpBalance`. If the values are not strictly equal, the function will revert with a `NoAllowance` error. 

Due to the requirement of `transferLPs()` that `allowances_` must equal `lenderLpBalance`, the user can only enter `lpsAmountToApprove_` as the current `lenderLpBalance` when using `approveLpOwnership()`.

This results in `transferLPs()` reverting with `NoAllowance` if `lenderLpBalance` undergoes any change, allowing attackers to design a DOS attack.

However, this validation is not necessary as it should only require `allowances_` to be greater than `transferAmount`.

## Impact

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by transferring a small amount of LP tokens to the owner before the transfer to the new owner is initiated. This would cause the `allowances_` value to be less than `lenderLpBalance`, causing the transfer to revert and the tokens to remain in the original owner's account.

Relevant code snippet from transferLPs function:
 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-ajna/blob/main/contracts/src/base/Pool.sol#L238-L250

```solidity=238
function transferLPs(
        address owner_,
        address newOwner_,
        uint256[] calldata indexes_
    ) external override nonReentrant {
        LenderActions.transferLPs(
            buckets,
            _lpTokenAllowances,
            owner_,
            newOwner_,
            indexes_
        );
    }
```

```solidity=512
function transferLPs(
        mapping(uint256 => Bucket) storage buckets_,
        mapping(address => mapping(address => mapping(uint256 => uint256))) storage allowances_,
        address owner_,
        address newOwner_,
        uint256[] calldata indexes_
    ) external {
        uint256 indexesLength = indexes_.length;

        uint256 tokensTransferred;

        for (uint256 i = 0; i < indexesLength; ) {
            uint256 index = indexes_[i];
            if (index > MAX_FENWICK_INDEX) revert InvalidIndex();

            uint256 transferAmount = allowances_[owner_][newOwner_][index];

            Bucket storage bucket = buckets_[index];
            Lender storage lender = bucket.lenders[owner_];

            uint256 lenderDepositTime = lender.depositTime;

            uint256 lenderLpBalance;

            if (bucket.bankruptcyTime < lenderDepositTime) lenderLpBalance = lender.lps;

            if (transferAmount == 0 || transferAmount != lenderLpBalance) revert NoAllowance();

            delete allowances_[owner_][newOwner_][index]; // delete allowance

            // move lp tokens to the new owner address
            Lender storage newLender = bucket.lenders[newOwner_];

            newLender.lps += transferAmount;

            newLender.depositTime = Maths.max(lenderDepositTime, newLender.depositTime);

            // reset owner lp balance for this index
            delete bucket.lenders[owner_];

            tokensTransferred += transferAmount;

            unchecked { ++i; }
        }

        emit TransferLPTokens(owner_, newOwner_, indexes_, tokensTransferred);
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review / ChatGPT

## Recommendation

The validation check in the transferLPs function should be updated to allow for allowances_ to be greater than transferAmount, rather than requiring them to be strictly equal. The updated code would look like this:

```solidity
if (transferAmount == 0 || allowances_[owner_][newOwner_][index] < transferAmount) revert NoAllowance();
```

and change  `approveLpOwnership()` to:

```solidity
function approveLpOwnership(
    address allowedNewOwner_,
    uint256 index_
) external nonReentrant {
    _lpTokenAllowances[msg.sender][allowedNewOwner_][index_] = type(uint256).max;
}
```
