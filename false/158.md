# drawDebt use inverted new LUP limit check, making user-specified LUP limit control void

## Summary

BorrowerActions's drawDebt() LUP limit check is now inverted, nullifying LUP level control that `limitIndex_` argument is designed to provide to a user.

## Vulnerability Detail

ERC20Pool and ERC721Pool versions of drawDebt() allow a borrower to specify the `limitIndex_` that should limit the resulting LUP in the terms of its index, which is positively correlated with the LUP price. Now this check is incorrectly applied, reverting good draws and allowing for bad ones, which increase the probability of user's position liquidation given that the user who supplied the limit and had the call succeeded assumes that the resulting debt is far from liquidation while it's otherwise.

LUP price being too low is a dangerous state for a borrower, as it increases the probability of liquidation and raises Neutral price level (as `NP = ... * TP / LUP`), making it more profitable to kick such a loan. So a borrower may naturally want to ensure that `NewLUPIndex > limitIndex_`, i.e. to control that LUP is not too low as a result of drawDebt() that pushes LUP lower by increasing the utilization.

Now the check is inverted, reverting the call when `vars.lupId > limitIndex_`, i.e. when it is the desirable situation for the borrower. More importantly, when `vars.lupId <= limitIndex_` the call will not be reverted, so the LUP level control of the borrower is rendered void.

## Impact

When a borrower specify `limitIndex_` they will be sure that as the call succeeded the resulting LUP isn't dangerously low. As it is in fact inverted the borrower is closer to liquidation than desired, while the protocol has signalled otherwise by accepting the call with such a limit.

This increases probability of the liquidation, signalling otherwise, and makes way for the associated asset losses for a user.

Given this and the absence of low probability prerequisites as drawDebt() with `limitIndex_` set is one of the base operations for the protocol, setting the severity to be high.

## Code Snippet

drawDebt() incorrectly treats higher LUP and `lupId` as a dangerous thing for a borrower, while it is vice versa, i.e. the check to be `if (vars.lupId < limitIndex_)` instead of the current `if (vars.lupId > limitIndex_) revert LimitIndexReached()` as it is the low LUP that brings the risk of liquidation to the borrower:

```solidity
        // borrow against pledged collateral
        // check both values to enable an intentional 0 borrow loan call to update borrower's loan state
        if (amountToBorrow_ != 0 || limitIndex_ != 0) {
            // only intended recipient can borrow quote
            if (borrowerAddress_ != msg.sender) revert BorrowerNotSender();

            // add origination fee to the amount to borrow and add to borrower's debt
            vars.debtChange = Maths.wmul(amountToBorrow_, _feeRate(poolState_.rate) + Maths.WAD);

            vars.borrowerDebt += vars.debtChange;

            // check that drawing debt doesn't leave borrower debt under min debt amount
            _revertOnMinDebt(loans_, result_.poolDebt, vars.borrowerDebt, poolState_.quoteDustLimit);

            // add debt change to pool's debt
            result_.poolDebt += vars.debtChange;

            // determine new lup index and revert if borrow happens at a price higher than the specified limit (lower index than lup index)
            vars.lupId = _lupIndex(deposits_, result_.poolDebt);
            if (vars.lupId > limitIndex_) revert LimitIndexReached();
```

Also, `limitIndex_ = 0` (or `limitIndex_ = eps`) should correspond to allowing any LUP price scenario (it's the analogue of the deliberate absense of the slippage check), but now zero `limitIndex_` will lead to always reverting the drawDebt() call via `if (vars.lupId > limitIndex_) revert LimitIndexReached()`.

`limitIndex_` is a user defined argument of ERC20Pool's and ERC721Pool's drawDebt():

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-ajna/blob/main/contracts/src/ERC20Pool.sol#L125-L146

```solidity
    function drawDebt(
        address borrowerAddress_,
        uint256 amountToBorrow_,
        uint256 limitIndex_,
        uint256 collateralToPledge_
    ) external nonReentrant {
        ...

        DrawDebtResult memory result = BorrowerActions.drawDebt(
            auctions,
            buckets,
            deposits,
            loans,
            poolState,
            borrowerAddress_,
            amountToBorrow_,
            limitIndex_,
            collateralToPledge_
        );
```

        uint256 amountToBorrow_,
        uint256 limitIndex_,

    ) external nonReentrant {
        ...

        DrawDebtResult memory result = BorrowerActions.drawDebt(
            auctions,
            buckets,
            deposits,
            loans,
            poolState,
            borrowerAddress_,
            amountToBorrow_,
            limitIndex_,
            Maths.wad(tokenIdsToPledge_.length)
        );

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider using the `vars.lupId < limitIndex_` or `vars.lupId <= limitIndex_` check, for example:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-ajna/blob/main/contracts/src/libraries/external/BorrowerActions.sol#L161-L180

```solidity
        // borrow against pledged collateral
        // check both values to enable an intentional 0 borrow loan call to update borrower's loan state
        if (amountToBorrow_ != 0 || limitIndex_ != 0) {
            ...

            // determine new lup index and revert if borrow happens at a price higher than the specified limit (lower index than lup index)
            vars.lupId = _lupIndex(deposits_, result_.poolDebt);
-           if (vars.lupId > limitIndex_) revert LimitIndexReached();
+           if (vars.lupId <= limitIndex_) revert LimitIndexReached();
```

The limit usually is inclusive, but `LimitIndexReached` error imply otherwise, so some version of the approach to be chosen.
