# Anyone can transfer approved LP tokens

## Summary
Anyone can call the `Pool.transferLPs` function and transfer previously approved LP tokens to the approved address.
## Vulnerability Detail
The [Pool.transferLPs](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-ajna/blob/main/contracts/src/base/Pool.sol#L238) function allows to transfer LP tokens from one address to another. Even though it requires [approving](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-ajna/blob/main/contracts/src/base/Pool.sol#L169) a transfer, actual transferring is left at the discretion of the approved address: approving allows the approved address to transfer LP tokens when appropriate. However, since the `Pool.transferLPs` function can be called by any address, the owner of the tokens may be impacted.
## Impact
Lender's LP tokens may be transferred to an approve address at an inappropriate time, impacting the position management strategy of the lender.
