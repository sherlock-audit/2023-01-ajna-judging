# The protocol does not properly handle fee-on-transfer/rebasing/deflationary tokens

## Summary

The protocol does not properly handle fee-on-transfer/rebasing/deflationary tokens. 

## Vulnerability Detail

Throughout the codebase, it is assumed that whenever `safeTransfer`/`safeTransferFrom` is called on a quote token or ERC-20 collateral, the total amount passed as input is the amount that the receiver gets. This is not the case for fee-on-transfer/rebasing/deflationary tokens. 

Notoriously, the [USDT](https://etherscan.io/address/0xdac17f958d2ee523a2206206994597c13d831ec7) token has the capability of charging a fee on transfer, and the [USDC](https://etherscan.io/token/0xa0b86991c6218b36c1d19d4a2e9eb0ce3606eb48) contract is upgradeable, which means it can, in theory, be updated to allow fee on transfers in the future.

## Impact

For some cases, the protocol might receive fewer tokens than expected, and the users might be credited more LPs than they should.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Do not assume that the amount passed into the `safeTransfer`/`safeTransferFrom` value is what the recipient receives. For example:

```solidity
// return value should be used in the internal accounting system instead of `amount`
function _transfer(address receiver, uint256 amount) internal returns (uint256) {
  uint256 before = token.balanceOf(receiver);
  token.safeTransfer(receiver, amount);
  uint256 after = token.balanceOf(receiver);
  return after - before;
}
```
