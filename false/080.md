# Users willing to use Cryptopunks as collateral can be frontrun if `offerPunkForSale()` is accidentally used

## Summary
The documentation states that cryptopunks will be used widely in the protocol. Currently, the ERC721Pool contract requires the user to set the punk token for sale and specify the minimum sale price as 0 wei in order to transfer the punk token to the target contract (as `msg.value` is not specified when calling `buyPunk()`) which may allow an attacker to front-run a victim user. 

## Vulnerability Detail
Approval of tokens can be done using the `offerPunkForSale()` and `offerPunkForSaleToAddress()` methods. Should the former be used, this could be exploited by  front-running a victim to get a free cryptopunk token. 

```solidity

    function offerPunkForSale(uint punkIndex, uint minSalePriceInWei) {
        if (!allPunksAssigned) throw;
        if (punkIndexToAddress[punkIndex] != msg.sender) throw;
        if (punkIndex >= 10000) throw;
        punksOfferedForSale[punkIndex] = Offer(true, punkIndex, msg.sender, minSalePriceInWei, 0x0);
        PunkOffered(punkIndex, minSalePriceInWei, 0x0);
    }

    function offerPunkForSaleToAddress(uint punkIndex, uint minSalePriceInWei, address toAddress) {
        if (!allPunksAssigned) throw;
        if (punkIndexToAddress[punkIndex] != msg.sender) throw;
        if (punkIndex >= 10000) throw;
        punksOfferedForSale[punkIndex] = Offer(true, punkIndex, msg.sender, minSalePriceInWei, toAddress);
        PunkOffered(punkIndex, minSalePriceInWei, toAddress);
    }
    
    function buyPunk(uint punkIndex) payable {
        if (!allPunksAssigned) throw;
        Offer offer = punksOfferedForSale[punkIndex];
        if (punkIndex >= 10000) throw;
        if (!offer.isForSale) throw;                // punk not actually for sale
        if (offer.onlySellTo != 0x0 && offer.onlySellTo != msg.sender) throw;  // punk not supposed to be sold to this user
        if (msg.value < offer.minValue) throw;      // Didn't send enough ETH   <------
        if (offer.seller != punkIndexToAddress[punkIndex]) throw; // Seller no longer owner of punk

        address seller = offer.seller;

        punkIndexToAddress[punkIndex] = msg.sender;
        balanceOf[seller]--;
        balanceOf[msg.sender]++;
        Transfer(seller, msg.sender, 1);

        punkNoLongerForSale(punkIndex);
        pendingWithdrawals[seller] += msg.value;
        PunkBought(punkIndex, msg.value, seller, msg.sender);

        // Check for the case where there is a bid from the new owner and refund it.
        // Any other bid can stay in place.
        Bid bid = punkBids[punkIndex];
        if (bid.bidder == msg.sender) {
            // Kill bid and refund value
            pendingWithdrawals[msg.sender] += bid.value;
            punkBids[punkIndex] = Bid(false, punkIndex, 0x0, 0);
        }
    }

## Impact
This was rated as a Medium in severity because this requires a user to accidentally use the `offerPunkForSale()` instead of the `offerPunkForSaleToAddress()` due to negligence . In addition to this, attackers should be monitoring the mempool to execute a front-running attack however, this attack is essentially free of change (other than gas).

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
It's recommended that WETH tokens withdrawn for ETH and transferred to the user as apart of the `msg.value` in the `payable` `buyPunk()` function and allow support for repayment in ETH. Through this fix, the tokens which were transferred to the attacker through the "purchase" of the punk are essentially the tokens loaned from the contract. This may add an additional expense to the attack which will provide less incentives for the attacker. If this is not possible,  It's recommended that users are at least highly cautioned to use the `offerPunkForSaleToAddress()` method in addition to specifying the target pool and bearing the risk of transferring such a valuable token on themselves.
