# The kick penalty affects taking, increasing BPF and quote/collateral tokens require for a take

## Summary
The kick penalty, besides penalizing borrowers, also affects taking: BPF may be increased; the amount of quote/collateral tokens required to repay the debt may be increased.
## Vulnerability Detail
As per the whitepaper:
> The moment that a loan goes into liquidation its debt is increased by 90 days of interest, based on the current interest rate. This is done to disincentivize borrowers from repaying their loans only after it has been liquidated.

However, the penalty also increases the total borrower's debt to be repaid, which affects taking in multiple way:
1. When TP < NP, the BPF may be higher than expected because the kick penalty increases TP: [the higher the debt, the higher the TP](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-ajna/blob/main/contracts/src/libraries/external/Auctions.sol#L1429). A higher BPF increases the bond reward and may turn it from a negative one to a positive one.
1. A higher debt will require more quote/collateral tokens to repay the debt ([Auctions.sol#L1143-L1155](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-ajna/blob/main/contracts/src/libraries/external/Auctions.sol#L1143-L1155)).
## Impact
Taking is affected in the following ways:
1. BPF increases, which increases the bond reward for kickers.
1. More funds is required to repay the debt.

Manual Review
## Recommendation
Consider storing the kick penalty in the `IPoolState.Borrower` structure as a separate value and add it to borrower's debt only when borrower repays a debt after a liquidation has started.
