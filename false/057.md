# Using TransferFrom on ERC721 tokens

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail

## Impact
the `transferFrom` keyword is used instead of `safeTransferFrom`. The sent tokens could be locked if any sender is in a contract and is unaware of incoming ERC721 tokens.
## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-ajna/blob/main/contracts/src/ERC721Pool.sol#L574

                   'ICryptoKitties(_getArgAddress(COLLATERAL_ADDRESS)).transferFrom(msg.sender ,address(this), tokenId);'

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider changing `transferFrom` to `safeTransferFrom` at line 574. However, it could introduce a DoS attack vector if any sender maliciously rejects the received ERC721 tokens to make the others unable to get their poolTokens. Possible mitigations are to use a try/catch statement to handle error cases separately or provide a function for the pool owner to remove malicious senders manually if this happens.
