# AJNA token does not have decreaseAllowance and increaseAllowance method implemented

## Summary

AJNA token does not have decreaseAllowance and increaseAllowance method implemented

## Vulnerability Detail

According to the read me of the AJNA_TOKEN.md, the external method are:

```solidity
### **External Methods:**
* approve
    - Allows an external address to spend a user’s tokens
* burn
    - Sends a user’s tokens to the 0x0 address
* burnFrom
    - External address sends a user’s tokens to the 0x0 address    
* delegate
    - Delegates votes from sender to delegatee
* delegateBySig
    - Delegates votes from signer to delegatee
* decreaseAllowance
    - Decrease the amount of tokens an external address is allowed to spend for a user
* increaseAllowance
    - Increase the amount of tokens an external address is allowed to spend for a user
* permit
    - Approve an external address to spend a user’s tokens by signature
* transfer
    - Transfer a user’s tokens to another address
* transferFrom
    - Transfer tokens from one address to another
* transferFromWithPermit
    - Transfer tokens from one address to another using Permit and avoiding a separate approval tx
```

However, if the we look into the write method of the AJNA token, increaseAllowance and decreaseAllowance method is missing:

## Impact

External protocol that wants to integrate with AJNA token may assume that the token has increaseAllowance or decreaseAllowance by reading the doc but because the token never implement this methods, the external integration transaction will revert.

## Recommendation

Either update the documentation of AJNA token or implement the decreaseAllowance and increaseAllowance method
