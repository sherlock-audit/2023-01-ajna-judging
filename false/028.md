# Bucket collateral is not properly decreased when lender withdraws collateral

## Summary

Collateral is not updated properly when a lender withdraw collateral against LP tokens.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-ajna/blob/main/contracts/src/libraries/external/LenderActions.sol#L622

`bucket.collateral` should be decreased of the amount that is withdrawn, i.e., `collateralAmount_`.

As a malicious user I could deposit and withdraw collateral token multiple times to inflate the collateral of the bucket without taking any risk.

## Vulnerability Detail

## Impact

This will screw all the calculations based on the bucket collateral. It will particularly, decrease the price of the collateral for all subsequent lenders depositing collateral into buckets.

## Code Snippet

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

`bucket.collateral  = bucketCollateral;` should be `bucket.collateral  -= collateralAmount_;`
