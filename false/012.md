# [High] Fraudulent ERC20 tokens

## Summary
Bad actors can create a pool with an erc20 token that returns "TRUE" before the transfer is happening

## Vulnerability Detail
On the drawDebt, RepayDebt, addCollateral, removeCollateral functions I recommend checking the balance of the smart contract for the given erc20 token (quote & collateral) before (a1) and after (a2) the transfer and add a require statement because some bad actors can create a pool with an erc20 token that returns true on transfer & transferFrom functions before actually sending the tokens. In this case, SafeERC is not efficient.

## Impact
Somebody can create a pool with a fraudulent Erc20 token and USDT(for example) as collateral.

Bob wants to take a loan and deposit USDT as collateral. Bob doesn't receive any ERC20 tokens so he can't pay back the loan and receive back the deposited USDT.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Check the ERC20 balance of the smart contract before & after a transfer occurs. Require that the balance after is equal to the balance before +/- (depending on the case) amount.
