# Incorrect EMA implementation leads to faulty interest rate updates

## Summary

Values in the EMA calculation are swapped compared to the whitepaper/specification. This will lead to EMA adjusting much slower to current values, leading to delayed interest updates.

## Vulnerability Detail

The EMA calculation is described in the whitepaper like this:

$\text{EMA}_{t+12hr}(x) = (1-\lambda)*\text{EMA}_t(x) + \lambda*x_{t+12hr}$

However, in the actual implementation the values for $\text{EMA}_t(x)$ and $x_{t+12hr}$ are swapped:

```js
//EMA_7D_RATE_FACTOR is equivalent to (1-lambda)
curDebtEma =
    Maths.wmul(poolState_.debt,  EMA_7D_RATE_FACTOR) +
    Maths.wmul(curDebtEma,       LAMBDA_EMA_7D
);

...

curLupColEma =
    Maths.wmul(Maths.min(lupCol, maxLupColEma), EMA_7D_RATE_FACTOR) +
    Maths.wmul(curLupColEma,                    LAMBDA_EMA_7D);
```

This will lead to the old EMA account for ~90% of the new EMA value, which will cause the EMA to lag behind the current value much stronger. This once again leads to the interest rate updates being delayed/wrong (i.e. updating when it shouldnt), due to using a much delayed value for target utilization.

## Impact

Faulty interest rate updates.

## Recommendation
Swap `EMA_7D_RATE_FACTOR` and `LAMBDA_EMA_7D` in both calculations shown above.
