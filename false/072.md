# pools with many subset nfts cannot be created due to gas limit

## Summary
In initialize of `ERC721Pool`, there is a for loop that will run through the array of token ids that the pool wants to accept as collateral. In the event that a large number of subset nfts is used, it will surpass the gas limit and hence revert, preventing pools with many subset nfts from being deployed.

## Vulnerability Detail

In `initialize` in `ERC721Pool`, `tokenIds` is provided by the pool creator to define the token id that they want to be accepted as collateral. A for loop `for (uint256 id = 0; id < noOfTokens;)` will go through the array and set the mapping of `tokenIdsAllowed` on chain to true for the specific id. In the event that the subset nfts is large, `intialize` will revert due to surpassing the block gas limit.

```solidity
    function initialize(
        uint256[] memory tokenIds_,
        uint256 rate_
    ) external override {
        if (isPoolInitialized) revert AlreadyInitialized();

        inflatorState.inflator       = uint208(1e18);
        inflatorState.inflatorUpdate = uint48(block.timestamp);

        interestState.interestRate       = uint208(rate_);
        interestState.interestRateUpdate = uint48(block.timestamp);

        uint256 noOfTokens = tokenIds_.length;

        if (noOfTokens != 0) {
            // add subset of tokenIds allowed in the pool
            for (uint256 id = 0; id < noOfTokens;) {
                tokenIdsAllowed[tokenIds_[id]] = true;

                unchecked { ++id; }
            }
        }

        Loans.init(loans);

        // increment initializations count to ensure these values can't be updated
        isPoolInitialized = true;
    }

```
## Impact
Large subset nfts pool as collateral cannot be deployed.

## Recommendation

Recommend using a merkle root as the basis for verifying the accepted token ids instead of storing on chain which can be gas intensive.
