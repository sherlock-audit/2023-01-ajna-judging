# Hardcoded token addresses are only valid for Ethereum mainnet

## Summary

Throughout the codebase, some contract addresses are hardcoded to their Ethereum mainnet deployment addresses. The issue is that the protocol is expected to launch on other network, in which case these addresses will not be meaningful.

## Vulnerability Detail

The contract `ERC721PoolFactory.sol` has the contract addresses for the CryptoKitties, CryptoFighters and CryptoPunks NFTs hardcoded. The issue is that Ajna is expected to be deployed on [other EVM-compatible](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-ajna/blob/main/README.md?plain=1#L20) networks, and these addresses will not be meaningful.

## Impact

Hardcoded addresses will not be meaningful on other chains.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Check for `block.chainid` equals to `1` on the hardcoded addresses
