# `ERC721Pool` doest not support NFT pools with a large subset of tokens

## Summary

The `ERC721Pool` contain unbounded loops on many different functions (`initialize`, `drawDebt`, `addCollateral`, `repayDebt`, `mergeOrRemoveCollateral`) over `tokenIds_.length`. 

## Vulnerability Detail

The aforementioned functions contain unbounded loops over `tokenIds` arrays. In particular, [`initialize`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-ajna/blob/main/contracts/src/ERC721Pool.sol#L98) will not support a large subset of tokens, as the transaction will revert due to out of gas.

## Impact

NFT pools with a large subset of tokens will not be created.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
            for (uint256 id = 0; id < noOfTokens;) {
                tokenIdsAllowed[tokenIds_[id]] = true;

                unchecked { ++id; }
            }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Use a merkle tree approach in order to check for the presence of an element in a set. This will enable the creation of NFT pools with a large set of tokens. See [Caviar](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-caviar) for an example implementation.
