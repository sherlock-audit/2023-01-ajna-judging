# Use block.number to represent timestamp elapse is not accurate in ethereum network

## Summary

Use block.number to represent timestamp elapse is not accurate in ethereum network

## Vulnerability Detail

In the current implemetation, block.number is used to track timestamp as the quoted code:

```solidity

  151          uint256 endBlock = startBlock + DISTRIBUTION_PERIOD_LENGTH;

  189          // check that the function is being called within the challenge period
  190:         if (block.number <= currentDistribution.endBlock || block.number > currentDistribution.endBlock + 50400) {
  191              return false;

  255          // Check if Challenge Period is still active 
  256:         if(block.number < currentDistribution.endBlock + 50400) revert ChallengePeriodNotEnded();
  257  

  288          // check that the distribution period has ended, and one week has passed to enable competing slates to be checked
  289:         if (block.number <= distributions[proposal.distributionId].endBlock + 50400) revert ExecuteProposalInvalid();
  290  

  310          // screening period ends 72000 blocks before end of distribution period, ~ 80 days.

  312  

  330              calldatas_,
  331:             block.number,
  332              distributions[newProposal.distributionId].endBlock,
```

note the usage such as endBlock + 50400 and endBlock + 50400 - 72000 to check if the voting time is within the screening stage or quadratic voting stage, these term comes from the white paper:

> To avoid an overwhelming number of proposals, the slate of projects is filtered down to
10 projects during a screening stage. Voting power in the screening stage is based upon a
snapshot of an address' voting power 33 blocks prior to the screening stageâ€™s start block,
where one token is equal to one vote. Votes can only be cast for a single proposal with all
of their voting power, and voters can only vote once in the screening stage. The screening
stage lasts for the first 80 days of the cycle. At the end of the screening stage, the 10
proposals with the most support are deemed eligible to be funded.

and

>  Each quarter (90 days), up to a 2% of the treasury can be distributed to projects that win a
competitive bidding process4
. This is the global budgetary constraint, GBC.

There are other hardcoded number of block to express the timestamp:

Iin ExtraordinaryFunding.sol

```solidity
/**
 * @notice The maximum length of a proposal's voting period, in blocks.
 */
uint256 internal constant MAX_EFM_PROPOSAL_LENGTH = 216_000; // number of blocks in one month
```

For example, in the ethereum mainnet, 216000 blocks can represent one month.

one days has 24 hours * 3600 seconds = 86400 seconds.

We assume one month has 30 days, and one month has 86400 * 30 = 2592000 seconds

We use 2592000 seconds / 216000 = 12 seconds, meaning we assume on average 12 seconds a new block is generated in ethereum mainnet.

However the block generation time is not strictly 12 seconds.

According to

https://ycharts.com/indicators/ethereum_average_block_time

The block generation time is subject to change and flulate.

For example, if the block generation time fluates to 16 seconds,

216000 block * 16 seconds = 3456000, which is far from the one month period (2592000 seconds)

## Impact

Use block.number to represent timestamp elapse is not accurate in ethereum network

And the protocol proposal and voting period can be settled either early if the block generation time becomes shorters or delayed if the block generation time is longer.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

I understand the opezeppelin voting related code also use block.number as well and to make the AJNA protocol compatible with the library block.number is used, We recommend the protocol use block.timestamp to keep track of the time elaspe and only use block.number to track and snapshot the voting power.
