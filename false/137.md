# Unsafe conversion may lead to Theft of unclaimed yield

## Summary
There is an unsafe conversion between `uint256` to `uint96` `RewardsManager.sol` that may cause Theft of unclaimed yield


## Vulnerability Detail
On `_claimRewards` in `RewardsManager` contract the `lastInteractionBurnEpoch` is being converted from `uint256` to `uint96`, `lastInteractionBurnEpoch` is being used in the reward calculation to decide from what epoch should the reward calculation start, thus by passing for example the value `79228162514264337593543950336` which is `1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000` in binary, after the conversion to `uint96` `lastInteractionBurnEpoch` will be equal to 0

## Impact
Currently, due to the fact that `epochToClaim_` is not limited by `currentBurnEpoch` to cause this bug will required lots of gas. BUT considering a naive fix to the `epochToClaim_` issue may result in allowing malicious users to receive the same reward multiple times as each call to `claimRewards` `lastInteractionBurnEpoch` will be set to `0` thus re-calculating the reward from the start each time.

## Code Snippet

```js
// ...
stakeInfo.lastInteractionBurnEpoch = uint96(epochToClaim_);
// ...
```

The next code can be found in `_calculateAndClaimRewards` and `calculateRewards`
```js
        uint256 lastBurnEpoch = stakes[tokenId_].lastInteractionBurnEpoch; // will equal 0 always

        //...
        
        for (uint256 epoch = lastBurnEpoch; epoch < epochToClaim_; ) { // will iterate from 0 
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
If `epochToClaim_` is always converted to uint96 anyway just receive it from the users as a `uint96`

```js
    function claimRewards(
        uint256 tokenId_,
        uint96 epochToClaim_
    ) external override
```
