# Extraordinary proposals can receive more tokens than eligible

## Summary

Two extraordinary proposals proposed at similar times (while no other extraordinary proposals are executed) can request the same amount of tokens (`proposal.tokensRequested`). But if the second proposal is proposed **after** the first proposal is successfully funded and executed, the second proposal could not request the same amount of tokens. It would have to be lower due to `ExtraordinaryFunding.sol#L86`.

## Vulnerability Detail

Proposing an extraordinary funding proposal with the `ExtraordinaryFunding.proposeExtraordinary` function verifies that the requested token amount is within (less than) a certain limit in `ExtraordinaryFunding.sol#L86`. The limit is based on the treasury Ajna token balance and decreases with an increasing number of funded extraordinary proposals. A maximum number of **10** extraordinary proposals can be funded.

If multiple extraordinary proposals are proposed while the number of funded proposals is unchanged, the limit for the tokens requested is the same for those proposals. At a later time, if those proposals pass voting, the proposals are executed and receive the requested (stale) token amount.

## Impact

The requested token amount of an extraordinary proposal is not checked when executing if it's within the same limits imposed by L86.

If another extraordinary proposal was successfully funded and executed in the meantime of the 1 month voting period for the proposal, the limit for the requested token amount is already lower than the `proposal.tokensRequested` amount.

This means that if multiple extraordinary proposals are proposed at a similar time and pass voting, the `tokensRequested` amount is stale and potentially too much.

## Recommendation

Consider re-checking the `tokensRequested` amount when executing an extraordinary proposal and make sure it's within the same or similar limits as when proposing.
