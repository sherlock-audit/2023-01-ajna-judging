# Approved operator of the PositionManager NFT cannot stake for Owner and claim reward for NFT owners

## Summary

Approved operator of the PositionManager NFT cannot stake / cannot memoralizePositions / cannot redeem position for owner

## Vulnerability Detail

The PositionManager NFT is implemented as ERC721 token, which 
has two ways to approve another user:

> Approve them to take actions with a given token (approve())
> Approve them as an "operator" for all your owned tokens (setApprovalForAll())

However, the code in RewardManager.sol only has the ownerOf check and does not check if the msg.sender is a approved operator.

## Impact

The approved operator cannot call RewardsManager.sol#stake for the owner of the NFT.

```solidity
function stake(
	uint256 tokenId_
) external override {
	address ajnaPool = PositionManager(address(positionManager)).poolKey(tokenId_);

	// check that msg.sender is owner of tokenId
	if (IERC721(address(positionManager)).ownerOf(tokenId_) != msg.sender) revert NotOwnerOfDeposit();
	
StakeInfo storage stakeInfo = stakes[tokenId_];
stakeInfo.owner    = msg.sender;
stakeInfo.ajnaPool = ajnaPool;
```

because the code only check if the ownerOf(tokenId) is the msg.sender but not check if the msg.sender is an approved operator.

because the stakeInfo.owner is sent to msg.sender, the approved operator cannot claim the reward for the owner of the NFT as well.

```solidity
function unstake(
	uint256 tokenId_
) external override {
	if (msg.sender != stakes[tokenId_].owner) revert NotOwnerOfDeposit();
```

Manual Review

## Recommendation

We recommend the protocol check if the msg.sender is an approved operator by the owner of the NFT as well in the codebase.
