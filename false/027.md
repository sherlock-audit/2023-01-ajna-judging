# `Maths.sol` always rounds up, but in some cases this is not desired

## Summary

The library `Maths.sol`, used for WAD/RAY math, always rounds up, but in some cases this is not desired.

## Vulnerability Detail

The library `Maths.sol`, inspired by ds-math, [always rounds up](https://github.com/dapphub/ds-math/issues/19). For example, `Maths.wdiv(2 ether, 3 ether)` yields `666666666666666667`. Other fixed-point math libraries, such as [solmate's SignedWadMath](https://github.com/transmissions11/solmate/blob/main/src/utils/SignedWadMath.sol#L74), for example, rounds down, so `wadDiv(2 ether, 3 ether)` yields `666666666666666666`.

Not always rounding up or down is desired. Appropriate care must be taken on each operation.

In particular, whenever the protocol is increasing its assets, it should round down, and only round up when it is increasing its liabilities.

For example, on the following scenarios we should round down:
- when adding credit to an account
- when sending funds
- when calculating earnings
- etc

## Impact

## Code Snippet

Here are some problematic occurrences that are rounding up but instead should be rounding down

1. Borrowers will have more LPs for a given set of collateral

2. Pool's assets are being overstated, which will overstate its reserves

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-ajna/blob/main/contracts/src/ERC20Pool.sol#L362

3. Pool's debt is being subtracted by rounded up value

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Take a look at all `Maths` operations and verify if they should round up or down. Consider the following keywords and whether the receiver/sender should be rounded up or down: repay, debt, collateral, price, reward, deposits, settlements, earnings.

See similar findings on [runtime verification's Uniswap v1 audit](https://github.com/runtimeverification/verified-smart-contracts/blob/master/uniswap/README.md#part-i-formalization-of-xyk-model-and-its-implementation), where they caught incorrect rounding up/down errors that [were fixed](https://github.com/runtimeverification/verified-smart-contracts/blob/master/uniswap/issues.md) before the contract went live.
