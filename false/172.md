# After auction settlement, remaining loan is not re-inserted to heap

## Summary

Any remaining loans after the auction settlement will not be reinserted into the heap. Therefore, the number of loans is wrong (decrease by 1).  And Loans.remove() is called again to remove other loan.


## Vulnerability Detail

As a result of settle, there's case of borrower's debt and collateral being remained.
Auction is removed, but loan isn't re-inserted into the loans heap.  It occures wrong noOfLoans, while totalDebt and totalCollateral are correct.

First, poolMinDebtAmount_ are mis calculated.
Second, let's assume that after settle, there is Debt and Collateral remaining for borrower.
When someone call _kick(), it mis-calculate the momp due to wrong noOfLoans, and furthermore, it calls Loans.remove() and remove wrong loan completely.


## Impact

_wrong momp calculation in _kick is wrong bond size and loss of funds for kicker_
_remove wrong loan, so loss of funds for depositors_


## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-ajna/blob/main/contracts/src/libraries/external/Auctions.sol#L749-L840

```solidity
// calculate auction params
uint256 noOfLoans = Loans.noOfLoans(loans_) + auctions_.noOfAuctions;

uint256 momp = _priceAt(
    Deposits.findIndexOfSum(
        deposits_,
        Maths.wdiv(poolState_.debt, noOfLoans * 1e18)
    )
);
```

```solidity
// remove kicked loan from heap
Loans.remove(loans_, borrowerAddress_, loans_.indices[borrowerAddress_]);
```

## Recommendation

You should re-insert the loan right after auction is settled.
