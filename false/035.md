# User A should not start flashloan for User B as receiver

## Summary

User A should not start flashloan for User B as receiver

## Vulnerability Detail

In the current implementation of the flashloan, user A can start flashlaon for User B by setting the User B as the receiver

```solidity
function _flashLoanQuoteToken(IERC3156FlashBorrower receiver_,
	address token_,
	uint256 amount_,
	bytes calldata data_
) internal returns (bool) {
	_transferQuoteToken(address(receiver_), amount_);

	if (receiver_.onFlashLoan(msg.sender, token_, amount_, 0, data_) != 
		keccak256("ERC3156FlashBorrower.onFlashLoan")) revert FlashloanCallbackFailed();

	_transferQuoteTokenFrom(address(receiver_), amount_);
	return true;
}
```

## Impact

Consider this case, user B flashloan contract is not protected properly, User B perform trade from token C to token D when the flashloan is triggered.

User A calling flashloan with user B's receiver address and keep converting token C to token D either in sub-optimal price and when User B are not willing to do so.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

We recommend the protocol change receiver to msg.sender when starting flashloaning instead of let User A start flashloan for User B.

```solidity
if (IERC3156FlashBorrower(msg.sender)_.onFlashLoan(token_, amount_, 0, data_) != 
		keccak256("ERC3156FlashBorrower.onFlashLoan")) revert FlashloanCallbackFailed();
```
