# The protocol still has crucial governance component

## Summary

The protocol still has crucial governance component

## Vulnerability Detail

According to the whitepaper, the protocol “requires no governance”

> The Ajna protocol is a non-custodial, peer-to-peer,
permissionless lending, borrowing and trading system that requires no
governance or external price feeds to function.

In the on-chain context of the spec, the admin privilege is N/A, meaning the admin should not interfere the running of the smart contract.

```solidity
DEPLOYMENT: Ethereum mainnet, Arbitrum, Optimism, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, Fantom, Tron, Avalanche
ERC20:  any - ERC20's are used in fungible, collection and subset pool types
ERC721: any - ERC721's are used in collection and subset pool types
ERC777: none
FEE-ON-TRANSFER: none
REBASING TOKENS: none
ADMIN: N/A
```

However, the ADMIN priviledge is not truely N / A.

## Impact

The admin priviledge is mainly in the AJNA token distribution.

The token used is AJNA, which is deployed and all 2,000,000,000 token minted

And a single wallet is holding all the token.

The User can mint Position NFT and memoralize positon and stake NFT to harvest AJNA token reward, but the admin needs to transfer the token or a port of the token to the reward manager to make sure the token reward is distributed.

The protocol also has a governance funding mechanism. The admin needs to also transfer the AJNA token into the gonvernance contract or transfer the token out to make sure the recipient can receive the funding.

Because of the AJNA token transfer and token balance management performed by the admin, the admin priviledge is not truely N / A.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

For rewardManager.sol and the governance grant contract, we recommend the protocol let the code mint additional AJNA when needed while setting the mint cap to reduce the admin governance interfere and avoid the manual token balance management to make the admin privilege truly N / A.
