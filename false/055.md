# Repaying debt or liquidation should make the account health but in-fact can create more debt

## Summary

Repaying debt or liquidation can create more debt

## Vulnerability Detail

According to the whitepaper, the interest is charged in compounded manner:

```solidity
Borrowers accrue interest on their debt, which compounds continuously. E.g. if a borrower has
$100 of debt and accrues $1 of interest, their new debt balance will be $101. All borrowers pay
the same rate of interest. As the debt increases, more collateral may be required to keep the loan
fully collateralized.
```

When repaying the debt, first the interest is compounded first

```solidity
function repayDebt(
	address borrowerAddress_,
	uint256 maxQuoteTokenAmountToRepay_,
	uint256 collateralAmountToPull_
) external nonReentrant {
	PoolState memory poolState = _accruePoolInterest();
```

For example, if user wants to pay 100 USDC, but the compounded interest can create 200 USDC more debt, the user's repayment does not make the account health.

There are other mechanism that can create more bad debt:

When a loan is subject to liquidation and the loan is kicked:

3 month of interest is added according to the whitepaper and the implementation

```solidity
// when loan is kicked, penalty of three months of interest is added
kickResult_.kickPenalty   = Maths.wmul(Maths.wdiv(poolState_.rate, 4 * 1e18), borrowerDebt);
kickResult_.t0KickPenalty = Maths.wdiv(kickResult_.kickPenalty, poolState_.inflator);
```

When the loan is in liquidation, the interest continue to compound and create more bad debt.

When a liquidation is taken, the 7% of the penalty is added to the debt:

```solidity
// if first take borrower debt is increased by 7% penalty
if (!liquidation_.alreadyTaken) {
	vars.t0DebtPenalty = Maths.wmul(t0Debt_, 0.07 * 1e18);
	vars.t0Debt        += vars.t0DebtPenalty;

	liquidation_.alreadyTaken = true;
}
```

For example, if the taker pays 100 USD to remove 100 USD debt, but 7% of the penalty is added based on the current debt, more than 100 USD debt can be created, and liquidation does not make the account health.

## Impact

Repaying debt or liquidation can create more debt, which make it diffult for liquidation to settle and bring the user to bankrupty quickly and trigger cascading chain of liquidation.

## Recommendation

We recommend the protocl do not charge the interset when the loan is in liquidated state.

Also, considering adding less debt and penalty to make the borrower easier to clean the debt.
