# Lack of support for moonbird nesting and transferring moonbird while nesting

## Summary

Lack of support for moonbird nesting and transferring moonbird while nesting

## Vulnerability Detail

In the current implementation when the ERC721Pool is created, the code below runs:

```solidity
NFTTypes nftType;
// CryptoPunks NFTs
if (collateral_ == 0xb47e3cd837dDF8e4c57F05d70Ab865de6e193BBB ) {
	nftType = NFTTypes.CRYPTOPUNKS;
}
// CryptoKitties and CryptoFighters NFTs
else if (collateral_ == 0x06012c8cf97BEaD5deAe237070F9587f8E7A266d || collateral_ ==  0x87d598064c736dd0C712D329aFCFAA0Ccc1921A1) {
	nftType = NFTTypes.CRYPTOKITTIES;
}
// All other NFTs that support the EIP721 standard
else {
	// Here 0x80ac58cd is the ERC721 interface Id
	// Neither a standard NFT nor a non-standard supported NFT(punk, kitty or fighter)
	try IERC165(collateral_).supportsInterface(0x80ac58cd) returns (bool supportsERC721Interface) {
		if (!supportsERC721Interface) revert NFTNotSupported();
	} catch {
		revert NFTNotSupported();
	}

	nftType = NFTTypes.STANDARD_ERC721;
}
```

the NFT is either classified as Crypto punk or crypto kitties or standard ERC721 NFT.

The moonbird is certainly can be classified as the Standard ERC721.

However, the moonbird has a special staking mechanism. the NFT owner of the moonbird can toggle the nesting on their moonbird by calling toggleNesting

https://etherscan.io/token/0x23581767a106ae21c074b2276d25e5c3e136a68b#code#F1#L319

and while the moonbird is on nesting mood, the normal safeTransferFrom cannot be called, to move the nested moonbird around, a special function safeTransferWhileNesting is called:

https://etherscan.io/token/0x23581767a106ae21c074b2276d25e5c3e136a68b#code#F1#L258

```solidity
    function safeTransferWhileNesting(
        address from,
        address to,
        uint256 tokenId
    ) external {
        require(ownerOf(tokenId) == _msgSender(), "Moonbirds: Only owner");
        nestingTransfer = 2;
        safeTransferFrom(from, to, tokenId);
        nestingTransfer = 1;
    }
```

In the current implementation of the ERC721Pool, neither the toggleNesting is supported nor the safeTransferWhileNesting is supported, the impact is listed below.

## Impact

First of all, moonbird is considered as one of the valuable blluechip NFT based on trading volume on opensea

https://opensea.io/collection/proof-moonbirds

Again, if the moonbird nesting is toggled on, safeTransferFrom cannot be used because it will revert in the line below:

https://etherscan.io/token/0x23581767a106ae21c074b2276d25e5c3e136a68b#code#F1#L281

```solidity
function _beforeTokenTransfers(
	address,
	address,
	uint256 startTokenId,
	uint256 quantity
) internal view override {
	uint256 tokenId = startTokenId;
	for (uint256 end = tokenId + quantity; tokenId < end; ++tokenId) {
		require(
			nestingStarted[tokenId] == 0 || nestingTransfer == 2,
			"Moonbirds: nesting"
		);
	}
}
```

then nested moonbird cannot be used as collateral to borrow token and generate yield for lenders because the code ERC721Pool only call safeTransferFrom to move the NFT from borrower's wallet to the pool.

```solidity
/**
 *  @dev Helper function to transfer an NFT from owner to target address (reused in code to reduce contract deployment bytecode size).
 *  @param from_    NFT owner address.
 *  @param to_      New NFT owner address.
 *  @param tokenId_ NFT token id to be transferred.
 */
function _transferNFT(address from_, address to_, uint256 tokenId_) internal {
	// slither-disable-next-line calls-loop
	IERC721Token(_getArgAddress(COLLATERAL_ADDRESS)).safeTransferFrom(from_, to_, tokenId_);
}
```

If the moonbird is not toggled and transfered into the ERC721Pool, the moonbird NFT cannot be toggled on and staked.

According to the website:

https://www.proof.xyz/moonbirds

Moonbird has 10000 Unique supply, at the time of writing this report, there are 9413 nested moonbird.

The average nesting period is 238 days.

Basically the most of the long term NFT holder of the moonbird prefer to toggle the nesting on at most of the time.

The toggled moonbird has benefits such as airdrop according to

https://twitter.com/moonbirds/status/1553771428230549504

https://luckytrader.com/nft/proof-collective/news/moonbirds-delivers-first-airdrop

Without supporting moonbird nesting while transfer and toggle moonbird NFT, basically the moonbird NFT holder are very not incentived to use moonbird as collateral and borrow from the pool at all because they will lose the nesting benefits (such as airdropped NFT and staking reward) given the high portion of the nested moonbird and long nesting period.

## Recommendation

We reocmmend the protocol support add special logic to support moonbird nesting.
