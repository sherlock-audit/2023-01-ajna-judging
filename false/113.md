# Borrower can add collateral even after 1 hour liquidation grace period.

## Summary

A borrower is still able to add collateral after the 1 hour liquidation grace period which would lead to loss of collateral.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `ERC20Pool::addCollateral()` function does not check if a loan is in auction and whether the 1 hour liquidation grace period has been passed.

```solidity
    function addCollateral(
        uint256 amountToAdd_,
        uint256 index_
    ) external override nonReentrant returns (uint256 bucketLPs_) {
        PoolState memory poolState = _accruePoolInterest();

        // revert if the dust amount was not exceeded, but round on the scale amount
        if (amountToAdd_ != 0 && amountToAdd_ < _bucketCollateralDust(index_)) revert DustAmountNotExceeded();
        amountToAdd_ = _roundToScale(amountToAdd_, _getArgUint256(COLLATERAL_SCALE));

        bucketLPs_ = LenderActions.addCollateral(
            buckets,
            deposits,
            amountToAdd_,
            index_
        );

        emit AddCollateral(msg.sender, index_, amountToAdd_, bucketLPs_);
```

The borrower would then loss additional collateral in the auction during take operations as the collateral they added would also be taken.

```solidity
    function take(
        address        borrowerAddress_,
        uint256        collateral_,
        address        callee_,
        bytes calldata data_
    ) external override nonReentrant {
        PoolState memory poolState = _accruePoolInterest();

        uint256 collateralDust = _bucketCollateralDust(0);

        // round requested collateral to an amount which can actually be transferred
        collateral_ = _roundToScale(collateral_, collateralDust);

        TakeResult memory result = Auctions.take(
            auctions,
            buckets,
            deposits,
            loans,
            poolState,
            borrowerAddress_,
            collateral_,
            collateralDust
        );
```

## Impact

The borrower would lose additional collateral.

## Recommendation

Add a check to the `addCollateral` function to check if the 1 hour grace period has passed.
