# Invalid Subset Hash parameter leading to unexpected behavior in `_isAjnaPool()` function.

## Summary

The smart contract has a vulnerability in the function `isAjnaPool()` where if the `subsetHash` parameter passed to the function is not valid or if the addresses passed to the `deployedPools()` function are incorrect, the function may not correctly identify valid Ajna pools. This could lead to unexpected behavior in the contract, such as an attacker using a malicious contract that is not a valid Ajna pool to manipulate the state of the contract and potentially cause loss of funds, unauthorized actions, and other malicious behaviors.

## Vulnerability Detail

Severity: `Medium`

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-ajna/blob/main/contracts/src/PositionManager.sol#L342-L343

`subsetHash_` parameter passed to the function is not a valid input and if the addresses passed to the `deployedPools()` function are incorrect. This could cause the function to incorrectly identify valid Ajna pools, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the contract.

Function `_isAjnaPool()` is intended to verify if a provided pool address was deployed by an Ajna factory. However, the function takes an input parameter `subsetHash_` and uses it to call the `deployedPools()` function from the ERC20PoolFactory and ERC721PoolFactory contracts. If the `subsetHash_` parameter passed to the function is not a valid input or if the addresses passed to the `deployedPools()` function is incorrect, the function may not correctly identify valid Ajna pools. This could lead to unexpected behavior in the contract, as functions that rely on the output of the `_isAjnaPool()` function may make incorrect assumptions about the state of the contract.

## Impact

It could potentially cause the following issues.

1. Functions that rely on the output of the `_isAjnaPool()` function may execute incorrectly, leading to unexpected behavior in the contract.
2. It can be used to execute reentrancy attacks, as the attacker can create a malicious pool and call the function with the malicious pool address and incorrect `subsetHash_`, this can cause the function to return true, allowing the attacker to execute the functions that rely on the output of the `_isAjnaPool()` function.
3. It may cause the contract to lose funds or assets, as the attacker can execute the functions that rely on the output of the `_isAjnaPool()` function and manipulate the state of the contract to transfer assets to attacker's address.
4. It may cause the contract to be frozen, as the attacker can execute the functions that rely on the output of the `_isAjnaPool()` function and manipulate the state of the contract, this can cause the contract to be stuck in a bad state and unable to execute any further actions.

## Code Snippet

By passing an invalid address to the `deployedPools()` function.

```solidity
// Attacker's contract
contract Attacker {
    PositionManager private positionManager;

    function attack() public {
        address fakePool = address(this);
        bytes32 validSubsetHash = positionManager.getSubsetHash();
        positionManager._isAjnaPool(fakePool, validSubsetHash);
    }
}
```
The attacker's contract creates an instance of the `PositionManager` contract and calls the `isAjnaPool()` function with a fake pool address and a valid `subsetHash` obtained from the `positionManager` contract. Since the `deployedPools()` function does not check for the correct pool address, it will return true, and the attacker can now use this fake pool to execute functions that rely on the output of the `_isAjnaPool()` function and manipulate the state of the contract. 

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To ensure that the `subsetHash_` parameter passed to the `_isAjnaPool()` function is always valid, and that the addresses passed to the `deployedPools()` function are always correct. This can be achieved by properly verifying the input parameters, and by adding additional checks to ensure that the passed addresses are valid Ajna pools.

```solidity
// Contract modification
contract PositionManager {
    // ...
    function _isAjnaPool(address pool_, bytes32 subsetHash_) public view returns (bool) {
        require(subsetHash_ != 0x0, "Invalid subset hash parameter");
        address collateralAddress = IPool(pool_).collateralAddress();
        address quoteAddress = IPool(pool_).quoteTokenAddress();
        address erc20DeployedPoolAddress = erc20PoolFactory.deployedPools(subsetHash_, collateralAddress, quoteAddress);
        address erc721DeployedPoolAddress = erc721PoolFactory.deployedPools(subsetHash_, collateralAddress, quoteAddress);
        require(erc20DeployedPoolAddress == pool_ || erc721DeployedPoolAddress == pool_, "Invalid Ajna pool address");
        return true;
    }
    // ...
}
```
