# possible DoS attack

## Summary
the array is missing pop() function 
## Vulnerability Detail
when the array is allowed to store values without ever deleting them at any point, then it will grow to be infinitely large. in the event you want to loop over it there will be unbounded gas cost.
## Impact
unbounded gas cost for arrays
