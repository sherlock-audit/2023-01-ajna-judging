## Summary

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-ajna/blob/main/contracts/src/libraries/external/BorrowerActions.sol

In this code, the functions drawDebt() and repayDebt() are responsible for managing debt transactions for a borrower. The code does not check if the sender has the necessary privileges to perform the operations of the 'drawDebt()' and 'repayDebt()' functions. This could potentially allow any user to draw debt or repay debt from the borrower's account.

The drawDebt() function allows a borrower to pledge collateral to the pool, and then borrow an additional amount of quote tokens against the collateral. The function calculates the origination fee and adds it to the amount to borrow, and then adds the debt change to the pool's debt. It then checks that drawing debt does not leave the borrower debt under the minimum debt amount, and that the borrower is not placed in a state of under-collateralization. The borrower's loan state is then updated with the new LUP, and the borrower's t0 neutral price is stamped.

The repayDebt() function allows the borrower to either repay their debt or pull collateral from the pool. It checks that the borrower has debt, and then calculates the new LUP. If the loan is in an auction, the function checks if the borrower is re-collateralized, and if so, settles the auction and updates the borrower's collateral with the value after settlement. If the loan is not in an auction, the function checks if the borrower has sufficient collateral to pull, and if so, removes the collateral from the pool and updates the borrower's loan state.

## Vulnerability Detail

The code presented has a lack of authorization checks, specifically within the 'drawDebt()' and 'repayDebt()' functions. This means that any user can call these functions, potentially allowing them to draw debt or repay debt from the borrower's account.

 

This vulnerability can be exploited in several ways. For example, if an attacker can call the 'drawDebt()' function from a borrower's account, they could potentially add debt to the pool, increasing the liquidity of the pool and increasing their own profits. By adding additional debt to the pool, the attacker could also decrease the Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio of the pool, which would increase the amount of collateral available to the pool.

The attacker could also call the 'repayDebt()' function from a borrower's account. This would allow the attacker to repay debt from the borrower's account without their permission, resulting in a decrease in the total amount of debt in the pool. This could be used to decrease liquidity and increase the cost of borrowing for other borrowers. In addition to the lack of authorization checks, the code also lacks input validation.

This means that attackers could potentially call the 'drawDebt()' and 'repayDebt()' functions with malicious input values, which could have unintended consequences. For example, if an attacker calls the 'drawDebt()' function with a large amount of debt, it could cause the LTV ratio of the pool to drop below the minimum required threshold, which would cause the pool to become insolvent.

## Impact

The lack of authorization checks in this code can have a severe impact on the security of the system, as it could potentially allow any user to draw debt or repay debt from the borrower's account. This could lead to unintended debt changes and decrease the collateral held by the pool, leading to potential financial losses for all participants in the system.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

1. To prevent malicious users from bypassing authorization checks, the code can be modified to include a check that verifies that the sender is the intended recipient before performing the drawDebt() and repayDebt() operations.

 2. This check can be included by adding the following code snippet: if (borrowerAddress_ != msg.sender) revert BorrowerNotSender();

3. This check verifies that the sender of the transaction is the borrower and if it is not, the transaction is reverted.

 4. This prevents malicious users from performing unauthorized draws and repayments and ensures that the borrower is the only one who can draw debt and repay debt from their account.
