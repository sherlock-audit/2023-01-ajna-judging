# Lack of support for ERC20 tokens that has more than 18 decimals

## Summary

Lack of support for ERC20 tokens that has more than 18 decimals

## Vulnerability Detail

In the current implementation of the ERC721PoolFactory.sol and ERC20PoolFactory.sol

the quoteTokenScale and CollateralTokenScale is calaculated with based on the token decimals.

In ERC721PoolFactory.sol, the code is

```solidity
uint256 quoteTokenScale = 10**(18 - IERC20Token(quote_).decimals());
```

and in ERC20PoolFactory.sol, the code is

```solidity
uint256 quoteTokenScale = 10 ** (18 - IERC20Token(quote_).decimals());
uint256 collateralScale = 10 ** (18 - IERC20Token(collateral_).decimals());
```

According to the on-chain context:

https://app.sherlock.xyz/audits/contests/32

The protocol intends to support any ERC20 tokens:

```solidity
DEPLOYMENT: Ethereum mainnet, Arbitrum, Optimism, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, Fantom, Tron, Avalanche
ERC20:  any - ERC20's are used in fungible, collection and subset pool types
ERC721: any - ERC721's are used in collection and subset pool types
ERC777: none
FEE-ON-TRANSFER: none
REBASING TOKENS: none
ADMIN: N/A
```

However, the code in the factory assume that the ERC20 has token decimals smaller than 18.

According to 

https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20#high-decimals

> Some tokens have more than 18 decimals (e.g. YAM-V2 has 24).

> This may trigger unexpected reverts due to overflow, posing a liveness risk to the contract.

The NEAR token in ethereum block also has 24 decimals as well, which is larger than 18 decimals.

## Impact

The code will revert when calcuting the token scaling factor in 

```solidity
10 ** (18 - IERC20Token(token).decimals());
```

if token decimals is larger than 18 decimals.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

We recommend the protocol scale the token decimal in different matter to make it compatible with token that has more than 18 decimals.
