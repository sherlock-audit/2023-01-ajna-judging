# Counting `tokenId` will be started from `2` , which results in unintended-counting of tokenId

## Summary
Counting `tokenId` will be started from `2` , which results in unintended-counting of tokenId (of NFT that lender's positions).

## Vulnerability Detail
`_nextId` is defined with `1` in order to skip `0` like below. This means that counting tokenId (of NFT that represents a position) would be supposed to be started from `1` .
[PositionManager.sol#L56](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-ajna/blob/main/contracts/src/PositionManager.sol#L56)
```solidity
    uint176 private _nextId = 1; // id of the next token that will be minted. Skips 0
```

However, when the **initial minting** is executed in the PositionManager.sol# `mint()` function, `2` is assigned as the next tokenId into the `tokenId_` variable and then it will be assign into the `_safeMint()` function.
[PositionManager.sol#L184](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-ajna/blob/main/contracts/src/PositionManager.sol#L184)
[PositionManager.sol#L194](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-ajna/blob/main/contracts/src/PositionManager.sol#L194)
```solidity
    function mint(
        MintParams calldata params_
    ) external override returns (uint256 tokenId_) {
        tokenId_ = _nextId++;  /// @audit - tokenId is incremented here.
        ...
        _safeMint(params_.recipient, tokenId_);    /// @audit - "tokenId_" that is assigned above would be used for minting here.
    }
```
Because `tokenId_` is incremented before a NFT is minted via `_safeMint()` function.
As a result, counting of tokenId (of NFT that represents lender's positions) will be started from `2`. 

## Impact
This lead to unintended-counting of tokenId (of NFT that represents lender's positions).

Manual Review

## Recommendation
For the [PositionManager.sol#L56](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-ajna/blob/main/contracts/src/PositionManager.sol#L56), consider assigning `0` into the `_nextId` instead of assigning `1` 
```solidity
    uint176 private _nextId = 0; // id of the next token that will be minted. Skips 0
```
