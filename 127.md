# For some settle conditions, settle() may revert

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
Formally, an auction is settleable if any of the three criteria listed above are met (with the time limit being set to 72 hours). A settleable auction can be settled by any participant, which does the following:
1. If debt is zero, it’s simply removed from the list of auctions. The borrower, having no debt, is then free to remove their remaining collateral
2. If the debt is non-zero and there is remaining collateral, collateral is placed into the top priced bucket’s claimable collateral, reducing the deposit by the corresponding amount up to the total amount of deposit available. The loan’s debt is credited the same amount as the reduction in deposit. This process is repeated until either the debt or deposit is zero.
3. If debt is non-zero but collateral is zero, the debt is reduced by min{debt, reserves} (see 3.3 Reserves). This also reduces the reserves by the same quantity, as the debt is an asset of the pool, and there is no offsetting reduction in pool liabilities. After this operation,either the debt is zero, or the reserves are zero. This operation effectively uses the
reserves to protect lenders from bad debt.
4. If there is still non-zero debt in the loan, but reserves are zero and the loan has no
collateral, the deposits are reduced by the quantity of debt in the loan, from the highest priced bucket downwards iteratively, with the loan’s debt reduced by the same amount. This repeats until the loan’s debt is zero. In this case, the most aggressive lenders are being forced to take on the remaining bad debt.


But in settlePoolDebt() if borrower.collateral != 0 , it reverts.

3. If the debt is non-zero and there is remaining collateral , this conditions are checked in the while loop below.

But this while loop cannot be enterable because when borrower.debt is != 0 , tx reverts.
## Impact
Some auctions cannot be settleable.
