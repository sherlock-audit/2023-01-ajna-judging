# Flash loans dont check deposit before and after which may result in the drainage of a pool

## Summary
According to the spec any ERC20 token can be used to create a pool. Not all ERC20 tokens follow the same standard and therefore, the protocol has to consider how tokens are handling transfers when the token address is arbitrary. Consider a token which returns true on every transaction and doesnt revert on failure with a check that the user has enough balance instead of a `require()` statement. This could create issues in the `flashLoan()` function. 

## Vulnerability Detail
This was rated a medium in severity because certain edge cases must be met in order to execute the attack. The SafeERC20 library only performs safe checks IF the token returns a bool which is a common misconception among engineers and isn't foolproof.

In addition to this, the flashloanable pool does not assert that the balance of the pool is consistent before and after the flashloan which may be exploited.

## Impact
If certain edge cases are met, an attacker could steal the sum of tokens flashloaned.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Recommend checking pool balance before and after flashloaning while taking fees into consideration and revert if the correct number of tokens aren't returned to add an extra layer of protection for the protocol.
