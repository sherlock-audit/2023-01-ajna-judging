# Lenders are forced to pay early withdrawal penalty when they remove quoteToken if pool has no collateral yet

## Summary
Lenders can add/remove quote token from the pool. They are required to pay an early withdrawal penalty if quote token is removed from above the PTP and they withdraw before `1 days`. However, in the case where pool has no collateral yet, (this can be due to all borrowers having fully paid back thier loans, or no users has added any collateral yet to take a loan) all lenders that wants to remove quote token are forced to pay a penalty regardless of the bucket they remove from.

## Vulnerability Detail
In `removeQuoteToken()`, early withdrawal penalty is applied under this condition.

```solidity
if (depositTime != 0 && block.timestamp - depositTime < 1 days) {
	if (removeParams.price > _ptp(poolState_.debt, poolState_.collateral)) {
		removedAmount_ = Maths.wmul(removedAmount_, Maths.WAD - _feeRate(poolState_.rate));
	}
}
```

It checks that the price bucket we are removing from should be less than or equal to the ptp. Otherwise, penalty is imposed. However, if `poolState_.collateral = 0`, the if condition will always be true as `_ptp()` is computed this way and returns 0 when `collateral == 0`.

```solidity
function _ptp(
	uint256 debt_,
	uint256 collateral_
) pure returns (uint256 ptp_) {
	if (collateral_ != 0) ptp_ = Maths.wdiv(debt_, collateral_);
}
```

## Impact
Lenders are forced to pay the early withdrawal penalty if pool has no collateral currently regardless of the buckets they are removing from.

## Recommendation
We should not impose a penalty when Lenders are removing quoteToken when there is currently 0 collateral.
