# Missing bankruptcy detection when removing NFT collateral lets bad debt accumulate

## Summary
When removing NFT collateral from an ERC721 pool, there's no detection whether the pool is bankrupt after the removal. As a result, the outstanding balance of LP tokens may be added to new deposits or moved to a different bucket. When added to new deposits, it may be redeemed for the newly deposited funds, causing a loss of funds for the depositors. When moved to a different bucket, it may be redeemed for that bucket's quote tokens, which will result in a loss of funds for the depositors of the bucket.
## Vulnerability Detail
Pool can end up in a bankrupt state: a situation when there's no collateral or quote tokens in a pool, but there's still a positive number of LP tokens. Currently, the protocol detects pool bankruptcy in three cases:
1. [when removing quote token](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-ajna/blob/main/contracts/src/libraries/external/LenderActions.sol#L359-L365);
1. when removing ERC20 collateral ([ERC20Pool.sol#L329](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-ajna/blob/main/contracts/src/ERC20Pool.sol#L329), [LenderActions.sol#L623-L629](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-ajna/blob/main/contracts/src/libraries/external/LenderActions.sol#L623-L629));
1. when calling [ERC721Pool.mergeOrRemoveCollateral](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-ajna/blob/main/contracts/src/ERC721Pool.sol#L280) ([LenderActions.sol#L471](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-ajna/blob/main/contracts/src/libraries/external/LenderActions.sol#L471)).

However, there's no bankruptcy check when removing collateral via the [ERC721Pool.removeCollateral](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-ajna/blob/main/contracts/src/ERC721Pool.sol#L318) function: the function calls [LenderActions.removeCollateral](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-ajna/blob/main/contracts/src/libraries/external/LenderActions.sol#L379), which doesn't have the bankruptcy check.
## Impact
If, as a result of removing liquidity from a pool via a call to `ERC721Pool.removeCollateral`, the pool ends up with 0 collateral, 0 quote tokens, and with a positive number of LP tokens, the bad debt won't be removed. The LP tokens can then be moved to a different bucket (using the [moveQuoteToken](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-ajna/blob/main/contracts/src/base/Pool.sol#L173) function; the [bankruptcy check](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-ajna/blob/main/contracts/src/libraries/external/LenderActions.sol#L224) will pass) and redeemed for quote tokens or collateral NFTs. Alternatively, the owner of the LPs may leave then in the bucket, wait for new collateral and/or quote tokens to be deposited by other lenders, and redeem the LPs for the new funds: the bankruptcy checks in [LenderActions.removeQuoteToken](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-ajna/blob/main/contracts/src/libraries/external/LenderActions.sol#L323), [LenderActions.removeCollateral](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-ajna/blob/main/contracts/src/libraries/external/LenderActions.sol#L405), and [LenderActions._removeMaxCollateral](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-ajna/blob/main/contracts/src/libraries/external/LenderActions.sol#L592) will also pass.

## Recommendation
Consider adding the pool bankruptcy check to the [LenderActions.removeCollateral](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-ajna/blob/main/contracts/src/libraries/external/LenderActions.sol#L379) function, similarly to how it's implemented in the [LenderActions._removeMaxCollateral](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-ajna/blob/main/contracts/src/libraries/external/LenderActions.sol#L623-L629) function.
