# fee on transfer token will cause accounting error

## Summary
In `drawDebt`, the `pledgedCollateral` and `t0Debt` is updated with user specified input before the transfer. However, with fee on transfer tokens, the received and sent tokens will be lesser after the transfer. This will result in user receiving lesser than recorded debt and also the protocol will have lesser collateral than recorded collateral. This will become problematic when repaying debt as protocol might not have enough collateral to send back to the last few borrowers. 

## Vulnerability Detail

Notice how the accounting is done before the transfer. 

```solidity
            poolBalances.pledgedCollateral += collateralToPledge_;

            // move collateral from sender to pool
            _transferCollateralFrom(msg.sender, collateralToPledge_);
```

```solidity
            poolBalances.t0Debt += result.t0DebtChange;

            // move borrowed amount from pool to sender
            _transferQuoteToken(msg.sender, amountToBorrow_);
```

Applies to `ERC20Pool` collateral and quote tokens and `ERC721Pool` quote tokens.


## Impact
1) Collateral recorded will always be more than what the pool has,  preventing final few borrowers or liquidity providers from being able to withdraw their collateral.
2) Debt recorded is more than what user receives.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Recommend using the common pattern that checks before and after balance. Do for all transfers in the protocol.

```solidity
uint256 balanceBefore = IERC20(_getArgAddress(COLLATERAL_ADDRESS)).balanceOf(address(this));
_transferCollateralFrom(msg.sender, collateralToPledge_);
uint256 balanceAfter = IERC20(_getArgAddress(COLLATERAL_ADDRESS)).balanceOf(address(this));
uint256 tokenAmount = balanceAfter - balanceBefore;
poolBalances.pledgedCollateral += tokenAmount;

```
