# Interest rate conversions are incorrect

## Summary

Annualized to daily/monthly/weekly interest rate calculation is not correct. 

## Vulnerability Detail

Since interest rates compound, the conversion between annual interest rates to daily/monthly/weekly is [not a simple ratio between the rate and the period](https://smallbusiness.chron.com/convert-annual-interest-rate-monthly-rate-1822.html).

## Impact

1. When a loan is kicked, the [penalty of three months](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-ajna/blob/main/contracts/src/libraries/external/Auctions.sol#L810) of interest is wrongly calculated.
2. The current annualize interest rate corresponding to [one week of interest](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-ajna/blob/main/contracts/src/libraries/helpers/PoolHelper.sol#L115-L120) is wrongly calculated.


## Code Snippet

```solidity
        kickResult_.kickPenalty   = Maths.wmul(Maths.wdiv(poolState_.rate, 4 * 1e18), borrowerDebt);
```

```solidity
        return Maths.max(Maths.wdiv(interestRate_, 52 * 1e18), 0.0005 * 1e18);
```

## Recommendation

Fix the effective interest rate calculations.
1. Three months of interest corresponding to the annual interest rate `i` is not `i/4`, but rather `(1+i)^(1/4)-1`
2. One week of interest corresponding to the annual interest rate `i` is not `i/52`, but rather `(1+i)^(1/52)-1`
