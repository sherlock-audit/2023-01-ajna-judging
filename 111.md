# Adversary can grief kicker by frontrunning kickAuction call with a large amount of loan

## Summary
Average debt size of the pool is used to calculated MOMP  (Most optimistic matching price), which is used to derive NP (neutral price). Higher average debt size will result in lower MOMP and hence lower NP which will make it harder for kicker to earn a reward and more likely that the kicker is penalized. An adversary can manipulate the average debt size of the pool by frontrunning kicker's `kickAuction` call with a large amount of loan. 


## Vulnerability Detail

NP (neutral price) is a price that will be used to decide whether to reward a kicker with a bonus or punish the kicker with a penalty. In the event the auction ends with a price higher than NP, kicker will be given a penalty and if the auction ends with a price lower than NP, kicker will be rewarded with a bonus. 

NP is derived from MOMP  (Most optimistic matching price). BI refers to borrower inflator. Quoted from the whitepaper page 17, When a loan is initiated (the first debt or additional debt is drawn, or collateral is removed from the loan), the neutral price is set to
the current MOMP times the ratio of the loan‚Äôs threshold price to the LUP, plus one year‚Äôs interest. As time passes, the neutral price increases at the same rate as interest. This can be expressed as the following formula for the neutral price as a function
of time ùë°, where ùë† is the time the loan is initiated.

```math
 NP_t = (1 + rate_s) * MOMP_s * TP_s * \frac{TP_s}{LUP_s} *  \frac{BI_s}{BI_t}
```

Therefore the lower the MOMP, the lower the NP. Lower NP will mean that kicker will be rewarded less and punished more compared to a higher NP. Quoted from the white paper, The MOMP, or ‚Äúmost optimistic matching price,‚Äù is the price at which a loan of average size would match with the most favorable lenders on the book. Technically, it is the highest price for which
the amount of deposit above it exceeds the average loan debt of the pool. In `_kick` function, MOMP is calculated as this. Notice how total pool debt is divided by number of loans to find the average loan debt size.

```solidity
        uint256 momp = _priceAt(
            Deposits.findIndexOfSum(
                deposits_,
                Maths.wdiv(poolState_.debt, noOfLoans * 1e18)
            )
        );
```

An adversary can frontrun `kickAuction` by taking a huge loan, causing the price for which the amount of deposit above the undercollaterized loan bucket to have a lower probability of surpassing the average loan debt. The adversary can use the deposits for the buckets above and the total pool debt to figure out how much loan is necessary to grief the kicker significantly by lowering the MOMP and NP.





## Impact
Kickers can be grieved which can disincentivize user from kicking loans that deserve to be liquidated, causing the protocol to not work as desired as undercollaterized loans will not be liquidated.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Recommend taking the snapshot average loan size of the pool to prevent frontrunning attacks.
