# Minting an NFT with a position on the same bucket as a previously minted NFT changes its deposit time

## Summary

Minting an NFT with a position on the same bucket as a previously minted NFT changes its deposit time.

## Vulnerability Detail

This issue happens because, after a position is memorialized on the `PositionManager`, this contract will centralize LP positions from different users, but these will be mapped to the same address from the point of view of Ajna pools (different users will be mapped as the same `lender` from the point of view of a `Pool`). 

If more than one user has memorialized a position to the same bucket index, [`LenderActions.transferLPs`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-ajna/blob/main/contracts/src/libraries/external/LenderActions.sol#L547) will update the `depositTime` to the maximum of the previous and new lender's values.

As a result, when a second user memorializes their position as an NFT, the first user's `depositTime` will be overwritten by the second user's (greater) `depositTime`.

## Impact

The `depositTime` is used when applying early withdrawal fee and on bankruptcy LP calculation. One of the impacts of this issue is that a user might incur in withdrawal fees because of another user. See the following scenario:

1. User1 memorializes position on bucket B
2. One day passes, so User1 should not be affected by early withdrawal penalty
3. User2 memorializes position on bucket B, and `depositTime` for both users (as they are using `PositionManager`) is updated to this new value
4. User1 withdraws, will incur in early withdrawal penalty

## Code Snippet

```solidity
            newLender.depositTime = Maths.max(lenderDepositTime, newLender.depositTime);
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Reconsider the `PositionsManager` architecture and the way the LP properties are stored on the Ajna protocol. Since positions are not tokenized by default, but instead are stored on state variables on each pool, it is arguably more complex to reason about transferring positions between two users. Conversely, the ERC-721 standard already provides straightforward methods for minting/burning/sending tokens for accounts. This issue could be fixed by removing the optionality of NFT minting through another independent contract (the `PositionManager.sol`), as it is centralizing other user's LPs, and instead to refactoring the Ajna pools so that every position is an ERC-721 NFT minted directly by the `Pool.sol`.
