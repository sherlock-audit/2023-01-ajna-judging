# Bucket indexes far off from zero have a higher relative absolute spacing

## Summary

Bucket indexes far off from 0 (corresponding to Fenwick index 4156), both positive and negative, have a higher absolute value for the bucket spacing with relationship with their adjacent buckets. This might not be suitable for pairs that have a high exchange rate. 

## Vulnerability Detail

Adjacent buckets `n` and `n+1` incur in a higher absolute deviation from their price `P_n = 1.005^(n-n')` whenever `n >> n'` (being `n'` the median bucket index). It is easier to see this by analyzing the function [`f(i) = 1.005^i`](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=expand+f%28i%29+%3D+1.005%5Ei) when `i` drifts from zero (i.e., when the conversion rate is far away from 1:1).

This means that for pairs that have a high exchange rate (e.g. WBTC/USDC), two adjacent buckets might be too far apart one from the other in absolute terms.

For example, as of January 19th, the exchange rate of WBTC/USDC is 21058.39, meaning that a rationale lender choosing between P_1997 = 21165.34381953559, P_1996 = 21060.043601527952 and P_1995 = 20955.267265201946 would face a high relative deviation of the accepted price. Other trading pairs might have an even higher exchange rate, such as WBTC/WDOGE, currently at 258258.40. 

By contrast, Uniswap v3 has 0.1% distance between its ticks, which means a much lower absolute error between different price points. 

## Impact

Some trading pairs might have buckets that are spaced too far apart. As a result, they might become unfit for the protocol.
