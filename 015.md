# Minimum borrow size can become too high

## Summary

The minimum borrow size can become too high if either large borrowers with in the pool or if no loans are repaid.  

## Vulnerability Detail

This can happen because the [`_minDebtAmount`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-ajna/blob/main/contracts/src/libraries/helpers/PoolHelper.sol#L100-L107) is 10% of the average loan size. 

## Impact

In either case, increasing too much the minimum debt amount can be detrimental to the health of the pool, as it either de-incentivizes moderate/regular borrowers, or creates a reverse incentive for borrowers to take a larger loan, further increasing the pool's debts. 

In an extreme scenario, a whale can take a large loan and effectively create a denial of service for regular borrowers to keep using the pool. 

Consider the following scenario

```bash
1. Borrower1 borrows B tokens
2. Borrower2 borrows B tokens
// so on and so forth
9. Borrower9 borrows B tokens
10. BorrowerWhale borrows 100B tokens
```

Now `_minDebtAmount` is `(9B+100B)/10 = 10.9B`, which is much higher than all previous debts 1 through 9

## Code Snippet

```solidity
    function _minDebtAmount(
        uint256 debt_,
        uint256 loansCount_
    ) pure returns (uint256 minDebtAmount_) {
        if (loansCount_ != 0) {
            minDebtAmount_ = Maths.wdiv(Maths.wdiv(debt_, Maths.wad(loansCount_)), 10**19);
        }
    }
```

Manual Review

## Recommendation

The recommendation is to re-evaluate this formula and derive it also from the distribution of past loans. Using the median instead of the average can be useful.
