# Using block.number to track timestamp elapse  is not accurate in the multi-chain setting

## Summary

Using block.number to track timestamp elapse  is not accureate in the multi-chain setting

## Vulnerability Detail

In the current implemetation, block.number is used to track timestamp as the quoted code:

```solidity
ecosystem-coordination\src\grants\GrantFund.sol:
   81              if (proposal.executed) return IGovernor.ProposalState.Executed;
   82:             else if (distributions[proposal.distributionId].endBlock >= block.number) return IGovernor.ProposalState.Active;
   83              else if (_standardFundingVoteSucceeded(proposalId_)) return IGovernor.ProposalState.Succeeded;

   90              if (extraordinaryFundingProposals[proposalId_].executed) return IGovernor.ProposalState.Executed;
   91:             else if (extraordinaryFundingProposals[proposalId_].endBlock >= block.number && !voteSucceeded) return IGovernor.ProposalState.Active;
   92              else if (voteSucceeded) return IGovernor.ProposalState.Succeeded;

  118              // screening stage
  119:             if (block.number >= currentDistribution.startBlock && block.number <= screeningPeriodEndBlock) {
  120:                 uint256 votes = _getVotes(account_, block.number, bytes("Screening"));
  121  

  125              // funding stage
  126:             else if (block.number > screeningPeriodEndBlock && block.number <= currentDistribution.endBlock) {
  127                  QuadraticVoter storage voter = quadraticVoters[currentDistribution.id][account_];

  210          // enable voting weight to be calculated during the voting period's start block
  211:         voteStartBlock_ = voteStartBlock_ != block.number ? voteStartBlock_ : block.number - 1;
  212          uint256 votes2 = token.getPastVotes(account_, voteStartBlock_);

  237              // screening stage
  238:             if (block.number >= currentDistribution.startBlock && block.number <= screeningPeriodEndBlock) {
  239                  hasVoted_ = hasVotedScreening[proposal.distributionId][account_];

  242              // funding stage
  243:             else if (block.number > screeningPeriodEndBlock && block.number <= currentDistribution.endBlock) {
  244                  QuadraticVoter storage voter = quadraticVoters[currentDistribution.id][account_];

ecosystem-coordination\src\grants\base\ExtraordinaryFunding.sol:

   79:         if (block.number + MAX_EFM_PROPOSAL_LENGTH < endBlock_ || extraordinaryFundingProposals[proposalId_].proposalId != 0) {
   80              revert ExtraordinaryFundingProposalInvalid();

   90          newProposal.proposalId      = proposalId_;
   91:         newProposal.startBlock      = block.number;
   92          newProposal.endBlock        = endBlock_;

  122  
  123:         if (proposal.startBlock > block.number || proposal.endBlock < block.number || proposal.executed) {
  124              revert ExtraordinaryFundingProposalInactive();

  127          // check voting power at snapshot block
  128:         votes_ = _getVotes(account_, block.number, abi.encode(proposalId_));
  129          proposal.votesReceived += votes_;

  131          uint256 currentDistributionId = distributionIdCheckpoints.latest();
  132:         if (block.number <= distributions[currentDistributionId].endBlock) revert DistributionPeriodStillActive();
  133  

  136              // Check if any last distribution exists and its challenge period is over
  137:             if ( currentDistributionId > 0 && (block.number > distributions[currentDistributionId].endBlock + 50400)) {
  138                  // Add unused funds from last distribution to treasury

  149          // set the distribution period to start at the current block
  150:         uint256 startBlock = block.number;
  151          uint256 endBlock = startBlock + DISTRIBUTION_PERIOD_LENGTH;

  189          // check that the function is being called within the challenge period
  190:         if (block.number <= currentDistribution.endBlock || block.number > currentDistribution.endBlock + 50400) {
  191              return false;

  255          // Check if Challenge Period is still active 
  256:         if(block.number < currentDistribution.endBlock + 50400) revert ChallengePeriodNotEnded();
  257  

  288          // check that the distribution period has ended, and one week has passed to enable competing slates to be checked
  289:         if (block.number <= distributions[proposal.distributionId].endBlock + 50400) revert ExecuteProposalInvalid();
  290  

  310          // screening period ends 72000 blocks before end of distribution period, ~ 80 days.
  311:         if (block.number > currentDistribution.endBlock - 72000) revert ScreeningPeriodEnded();
  312  

  330              calldatas_,
  331:             block.number,
  332              distributions[newProposal.distributionId].endBlock,
```

note the usage such as endBlock + 50400 and endBlock + 50400 - 72000 to check if the voting time is within the screening stage or quadratic voting stage, these term comes from the white paper:

> To avoid an overwhelming number of proposals, the slate of projects is filtered down to
10 projects during a screening stage. Voting power in the screening stage is based upon a
snapshot of an address' voting power 33 blocks prior to the screening stageâ€™s start block,
where one token is equal to one vote. Votes can only be cast for a single proposal with all
of their voting power, and voters can only vote once in the screening stage. The screening
stage lasts for the first 80 days of the cycle. At the end of the screening stage, the 10
proposals with the most support are deemed eligible to be funded.

and

>  Each quarter (90 days), up to a 2% of the treasury can be distributed to projects that win a
competitive bidding process4
. This is the global budgetary constraint, GBC.

There are other hardcoded number of block to express the timestamp:

Iin ExtraordinaryFunding.sol

```solidity
/**
 * @notice The maximum length of a proposal's voting period, in blocks.
 */
uint256 internal constant MAX_EFM_PROPOSAL_LENGTH = 216_000; // number of blocks in one month
```

However, using block.number to express the concept of quarters, 80 days or 10 days or one month is not accurate at all in the multi-chain setting.

According to the on-chain context of the protocol:

```solidity
DEPLOYMENT: Ethereum mainnet, Arbitrum, Optimism, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, Fantom, Tron, Avalanche
ERC20:  any - ERC20's are used in fungible, collection and subset pool types
ERC721: any - ERC721's are used in collection and subset pool types
ERC777: none
FEE-ON-TRANSFER: none
REBASING TOKENS: none
ADMIN: N/A
```

the protocol plans to deploy the contract in multi-chain and different blockchain has different block generation time.

For example, in the ethereum mainnet, 216000 blocks can represent one month.

one days has 24 hours * 3600 seconds = 86400 seconds.

We assume one month has 30 days, and one month has 86400 * 30 = 2592000 secons

We use 2592000 seconds / 216000 = 12 seconds, meaning we assume on average 12 seconds a new block is generated in ethereum mainnet, which is fine.

However, in other blockchain, for example, in polygon, the blockchain generation time is around 2 seconds:

Using the hardcoded number blok elapse to represent timestamp elapse in non-ethereum blockchain is severely not accurate and the voting period (granting period) can be significantly shorter.

## Impact

Using the hardcoded number blok elapse to represent timestamp elapse in non-ethereum blockchain is severely not accurate and the voting period (granting period) can be significantly shorter.

## Recommendation

I understand the opezeppelin voting related code also use block.number as well and to make the AJNA protocol compatible with the library block.number is used, so the recommandation is instead of hardcode the block.number elpase time, pass the elapase time in the constructor and make it configurable in different blockchain.
