# Manipulation of target utilization via flash loans

## Summary

Lack of withdrawal penalty for early collateral removals poses a risk of manipulation through flashloans despite EMA usage.

## Vulnerability Detail

The [Master Spec](https://docsend.com/view/ai74yqgzjp3yydyt) document describes how the manipulation of interest rates is meant to be deterred. For quote token deposits, a withdrawal penalty is applied for removals within 24h of deposits:

```js
// apply early withdrawal penalty if quote token is removed from above the PTP
if (depositTime != 0 && block.timestamp - depositTime < 1 days) {
    if (removeParams.price > _ptp(poolState_.debt, poolState_.collateral)) {
        removedAmount_ = Maths.wmul(removedAmount_, Maths.WAD - _feeRate(poolState_.rate));
    }
}
```

 For collateral deposits there is no such penalty, instead the `EMA of TU prevents large manipulative collateral
deposits` (according to the Master Spec document). The idea behind this is that a malicious actor would be required to risk having his collateral in the pool for a prolonged time to manipulate the EMA as well as the related target utilization.

However, due to the fact that the EMA is only recorded every 12 hours, a malcious actor could perform a large collateral deposit using a flash loan (and instantly withdrawing) whenever the update is enabled. This way the EMA for target utilization can be manipulated risk free (except for flash loan fees).

## Impact

Manipulation of target utilization to affect interest rates.
