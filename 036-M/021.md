# `ERC721PoolFactory` pool creation is not order-invariant on the subset of token IDs

## Summary

`ERC721PoolFactory` pool creation is not order-invariant on the subset of token IDs. As a result, pools might be incorrectly created, and more than one pool containing the same set of NFTs might exist.


## Vulnerability Detail

The function `ERC721PoolFactory.getNFTSubsetHash` uses a simple `keccak256` on the `abi.encodePacked` array of token Ids for a pool that contains a subset of NFTs. The issue is that this function is not order-invariant and does not validates duplicates. For example, calling it on the array `[1,2]` will yield a different hash from `[2,1]`, while these are the same subset. In addition, the array `[2,2]` will not revert and will return a different hash from `[2]`.

## Impact

Pools might be incorrectly created, and more than one pool containing the same set of NFTs might exist.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Use a merkle tree root of token IDs for the subset hash. Alternatively, loop through all `tokenIds_` and revert in case of duplicates or if they are unordered.
