# Tokens with more than 18 decimal points will cause issues.

## Summary

It is assumed that the maximum number of decimals for each token is 18. However uncommon, but it is possible to have tokens with more than 18 decimals, as an Example [[YAMv2](https://etherscan.io/token/0xaba8cac6866b83ae4eec97dd07ed254282f6ad8a)](https://etherscan.io/token/0xaba8cac6866b83ae4eec97dd07ed254282f6ad8a) has 24 decimals. This can result in broken code flow.

## Impact

The transaction would be reverted and user won't be able to deploy pool with such tokens. 

## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-ajna/blob/main/contracts/src/ERC20PoolFactory.sol#L53

`contracts/src/ERC20PoolFactory.sol`

```solidity
function deployPool(
        address collateral_, address quote_, uint256 interestRate_
    ) external canDeploy(ERC20_NON_SUBSET_HASH, collateral_, quote_, interestRate_) returns (address pool_) {
        uint256 quoteTokenScale = 10 ** (18 - IERC20Token(quote_).decimals());
        uint256 collateralScale = 10 ** (18 - IERC20Token(collateral_).decimals());
```

## Tool used

Manual Review


## Recommendation

Make sure the code won’t fail in case the token’s decimals is more than 18.
