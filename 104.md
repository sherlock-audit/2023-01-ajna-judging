# Settled collateral of a borrower aren't available for lenders until borrower's debt is fully cleared

## Summary

ERC721Pool's settle() lacks collateral ids array rebalance when the settlement isn't full, i.e. when `t0DebtRemaining > 0`.

## Vulnerability Detail

Auctions's settlePoolDebt() returns current state of the borrower after the settlement. If any of borrower's collateral id were removed from them it needs to be accounted for, but when `t0DebtRemaining > 0` this doesn't happen, i.e. removed borrower's tokens aren't added to the buckets cumulative collateral ids array and so this collateral is still unavailable for lenders.

## Impact

The settled collateral of the borrower will not be available for LP's withdrawal as the corresponding function will revert on an attempt to extract token ids from `bucketTokenIds` array.

The length of such freeze can vary up to be permanent, for example if there is no funds (reserves and deposits) to fully settle the borrower. This is principal fund loss scenario for the lenders, but given the prerequisite of the full default setting the severity to be medium.

## Code Snippet

When a borrower has some unsettled debt, `t0DebtRemaining > 0`, all of their collateral remain locked with `borrowerTokenIds` as _rebalanceTokens() isn't called in this case:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-ajna/blob/main/contracts/src/ERC721Pool.sol#L353-L385

```solidity
    function settle(
        address borrowerAddress_,
        uint256 maxDepth_
    ) external nonReentrant override {
        PoolState memory poolState = _accruePoolInterest();

        uint256 assets = Maths.wmul(poolBalances.t0Debt, poolState.inflator) + _getPoolQuoteTokenBalance();
        uint256 liabilities = Deposits.treeSum(deposits) + auctions.totalBondEscrowed + reserveAuction.unclaimed;

        SettleParams memory params = SettleParams(
            {
                borrower:    borrowerAddress_,
                reserves:    (assets > liabilities) ? (assets-liabilities) : 0,
                inflator:    poolState.inflator,
                bucketDepth: maxDepth_,
                poolType:    poolState.poolType
            }
        );
        (
            uint256 collateralRemaining,
            uint256 t0DebtRemaining,
            uint256 collateralSettled,
            uint256 t0DebtSettled
        ) = Auctions.settlePoolDebt(
            auctions,
            buckets,
            deposits,
            loans,
            params
        );

        // slither-disable-next-line incorrect-equality
        if (t0DebtRemaining == 0) _rebalanceTokens(params.borrower, collateralRemaining);
```

This can happen when settlement exits when `params_.bucketDepth == 0`:

            borrower.t0Debt -= Maths.min(borrower.t0Debt, (params_.reserves / params_.inflator) * 1e18);

            // if there's still debt after settling from reserves then start to forgive amount from next HPB
            // loop through remaining buckets if there's still debt to settle
            while (params_.bucketDepth != 0 && borrower.t0Debt != 0) {

            }
        }

        t0DebtRemaining_ =  borrower.t0Debt;

        emit Settle(params_.borrower, t0DebtSettled_);

            // settle auction
            borrower.collateral = _settleAuction(
                auctions_,

## Recommendation

Consider rebalancing each time when there is something to rebalance, for example:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-ajna/blob/main/contracts/src/ERC721Pool.sol#L353-L385

```solidity
    function settle(
        address borrowerAddress_,
        uint256 maxDepth_
    ) external nonReentrant override {
        ...
        (
            uint256 collateralRemaining,
            uint256 t0DebtRemaining,
            uint256 collateralSettled,
            uint256 t0DebtSettled
        ) = Auctions.settlePoolDebt(
            ...
        );

        // slither-disable-next-line incorrect-equality
-        if (t0DebtRemaining == 0) _rebalanceTokens(params.borrower, collateralRemaining);
+        if (collateralSettled > 0) _rebalanceTokens(params.borrower, collateralRemaining);
```
