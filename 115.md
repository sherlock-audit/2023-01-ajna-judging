# The solgraph visualization of 'PoolInfoUtils.sol '

## In this specific visualization, most of the nodes (except "indexToPrice" and "priceToIndex") are assigned the color yellow, which indicates the presence of high-level abstractions or potential security risks. However, the exact impact of these risks cannot be determined without further analysis of the smart contract code and its deployment environment.

## A visualization of the function calls and interactions between different contract functions, and it is not possible to determine the presence of vulnerabilities just by looking at it. 

## The report alone does not provide information about vulnerabilities or potential security risks in the code. A more in-depth security analysis and review of the code is necessary to identify any potential vulnerabilities or security risks.

Manual Review

## A more comprehensive security analysis of the contract's source code and its deployment on a blockchain network is necessary to identify any potential vulnerabilities. This may include manual code review, automated security tools, and testing on a blockchain network.
