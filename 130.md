# minimumBorrow becomes too high if sum of first 10 debts are so much


## Summary

When the sum of first 10 debts of pool are way high, some small(reasonable yet) borrowers are not able to borrow due to high minimumBorrow value.


## Vulnerability Detail

minimumBorrow = (Total Debt / Total Number of Loans) * 0.1
If Total Debt is $1M, minimumBorrow is $10K.
No one can borrow less than 10K anymore.


## Impact

_Denial of Service_


## Code Snippet

```solidity
minDebtAmount_ = Maths.wdiv(Maths.wdiv(debt_, Maths.wad(loansCount_)), 10**19);
```


## Tool used

Manual Review


## Recommendation

minimumBorrow is mitigate an attack where dust loans are opened to prop up the HTP and lock in depositors.
In other words, lenders can't withdraw and decrease LUP when even HTP's debt is zero-like small.
I recommend to update the calculation method of HTP, as the lowest acceptable price comparing to LUP.
