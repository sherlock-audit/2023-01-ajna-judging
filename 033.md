# Flashloan caller can double paying the flashloaned amount

## Summary

Flashloan caller can double paying the loaned amount

## Vulnerability Detail

The current implementation of the flashloan is attached below:

```solidity
/// @inheritdoc FlashloanablePool
function flashLoan(
	IERC3156FlashBorrower receiver_,
	address token_,
	uint256 amount_,
	bytes calldata data_
) external override(IERC3156FlashLender, FlashloanablePool) nonReentrant returns (bool) {
	if (token_ == _getArgAddress(QUOTE_ADDRESS)) return _flashLoanQuoteToken(receiver_, token_, amount_, data_);

	if (token_ == _getArgAddress(COLLATERAL_ADDRESS)) {
		_transferCollateral(address(receiver_), amount_);

		if (receiver_.onFlashLoan(msg.sender, token_, amount_, 0, data_) !=
			keccak256("ERC3156FlashBorrower.onFlashLoan")) revert FlashloanCallbackFailed();

		_transferCollateralFrom(address(receiver_), amount_);
		return true;
	}

	revert FlashloanUnavailableForToken();
}
```

and

```solidity
function _flashLoanQuoteToken(IERC3156FlashBorrower receiver_,
	address token_,
	uint256 amount_,
	bytes calldata data_
) internal returns (bool) {
	_transferQuoteToken(address(receiver_), amount_);

	if (receiver_.onFlashLoan(msg.sender, token_, amount_, 0, data_) != 
		keccak256("ERC3156FlashBorrower.onFlashLoan")) revert FlashloanCallbackFailed();

	_transferQuoteTokenFrom(address(receiver_), amount_);
	return true;
}
```

The problem is that the code does not check the token balance before and after the flashloan, the code send the token then forcefully pull the token from the receiver.

If within the flashloan callback, the code refund and transfer the borrowed amount back, the code will still try to forcefully pull the token from the receiver address, then the user end up double paying the flashloaned amount.

```solidity
	if (receiver_.onFlashLoan(msg.sender, token_, amount_, 0, data_) != 
		keccak256("ERC3156FlashBorrower.onFlashLoan")) revert FlashloanCallbackFailed();
```

## Impact

If within the flashloan callback, the code refund and transfer the borrowed amount back, the code will still try to forcefully pull the token from the receiver address, then the user end up double paying the flashloaned amount.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

The flashloan implementation should use balanceOf(address(contract)) of the flashloaned token to validate that the user pay the flashloan within the callback instead of forcefully pull the token from the receiver after the flashloan callback.
