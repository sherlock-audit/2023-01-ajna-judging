# ERC721Pool's take will proceed with truncated collateral amount and full debt when borrower's collateral is fractional

## Summary

Caller of take() can end up paying the debt corresponding to the fractional ERC721 collateral of a borrower, but receiving only truncated part of the this collateral in return (paying the debt for `1.9`, receiving `1.0`), with the borrower keeping the remainder.

## Vulnerability Detail

Fractional part of ERC721 collateral is gifted to the borrower in Auctions's _take() (L889-898) when `params_.collateral` doesn't allow an increase. Say when `vars.collateralAmount = params_.collateral = 1.9e18`, while taker specified collateral is `2`, it will proceed with paying the debt corresponding to `1.9e18`, which was calculated before in _calculateTakeFlowsAndBondChange(), but will pay the caller only `1e18` of collateral, leaving `0.9e18` with the borrower at caller's expense.

It happens only when `params_.collateral = borrower.collateral` isn't whole 18dp integer, the state that can periodically occur after ERC721Pool's bucketTake(), which applies _calculateTakeFlowsAndBondChange() result to the borrower's balance without rounding, so a partial bucketTake() will leave it as a 18dp fraction.

## Impact

Caller's funds will be lost as they pay borrower's debt according to the untruncated `params_.collateral` value, but receive only truncated amount of collateral.

As both take() and bucketTake() are routine operations and there are no low probability prerequisites, and given the loss of funds for the taker, setting the severity to be high.

## Code Snippet

Debt is calculated off `min(params_.collateral, params_.takeCollateral)`, but if `params_.collateral` is a fraction, say `1.9e18`, the `0.9e18` of collateral is gifted back to the borrower:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-ajna/blob/main/contracts/src/libraries/external/Auctions.sol#L854-L909

```solidity
    function _take(
        AuctionsState storage auctions_,
        TakeParams memory params_
    ) internal returns (uint256, uint256, uint256, uint256, uint256, uint256) {
        ...

        vars = _calculateTakeFlowsAndBondChange(
            Maths.min(params_.collateral, params_.takeCollateral),
            params_.inflator,
            params_.collateralScale,
            vars
        );

        ...

        if (params_.poolType == uint8(PoolType.ERC721)) {
            // slither-disable-next-line divide-before-multiply
            uint256 collateralTaken = (vars.collateralAmount / 1e18) * 1e18; // solidity rounds down, so if 2.5 it will be 2.5 / 1 = 2

            if (collateralTaken != vars.collateralAmount && params_.collateral >= collateralTaken + 1e18) { // collateral taken not a round number
                collateralTaken += 1e18; // round up collateral to take
                // taker should send additional quote tokens to cover difference between collateral needed to be taken and rounded collateral, at auction price
                // borrower will get quote tokens for the difference between rounded collateral and collateral taken to cover debt
                vars.excessQuoteToken = Maths.wmul(collateralTaken - vars.collateralAmount, vars.auctionPrice);
            }

            vars.collateralAmount = collateralTaken;
        }

        return ...;
    }
```

`params_.takeCollateral` is caller specified collateral value, while `params_.collateral` is `borrower.collateral`:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-ajna/blob/main/contracts/src/libraries/external/Auctions.sol#L538-L571

```solidity
    function take(
        AuctionsState storage auctions_,
        mapping(uint256 => Bucket) storage buckets_,
        DepositsState storage deposits_,
        LoansState storage loans_,
        PoolState memory poolState_,
        address borrowerAddress_,
        uint256 collateral_,
        uint256 collateralScale_
    ) external returns (TakeResult memory result_) {
        Borrower memory borrower = loans_.borrowers[borrowerAddress_];

        // revert if borrower's collateral is 0 or if maxCollateral to be taken is 0
        if (borrower.collateral == 0 || collateral_ == 0) revert InsufficientCollateral();

        (
            result_.collateralAmount,
            result_.quoteTokenAmount,
            result_.t0RepayAmount,
            borrower.t0Debt,
            result_.t0DebtPenalty,
            result_.excessQuoteToken
        ) = _take(
            auctions_,
            TakeParams({
                borrower:        borrowerAddress_,
                collateral:      borrower.collateral,
                t0Debt:          borrower.t0Debt,
                takeCollateral:  collateral_,
                inflator:        poolState_.inflator,
                poolType:        poolState_.poolType,
                collateralScale: collateralScale_
            })
        );
```

Caller specified `params_.takeCollateral = collateral_` of ERC721Pool's take() is always whole 1e18 integer via `Maths.wad(collateral_)`:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-ajna/blob/main/contracts/src/ERC721Pool.sol#L405-L422

```solidity
    function take(
        address        borrowerAddress_,
        uint256        collateral_,
        address        callee_,
        bytes calldata data_
    ) external override nonReentrant {
        PoolState memory poolState = _accruePoolInterest();

        TakeResult memory result = Auctions.take(
            auctions,
            buckets,
            deposits,
            loans,
            poolState,
            borrowerAddress_,
            Maths.wad(collateral_),
            1
        );
```

But `params_.collateral = borrower.collateral` can be fractional as bucketTake() do not round collateral result in the ERC721 case and subtract this result from `borrower.collateral`:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-ajna/blob/main/contracts/src/libraries/external/Auctions.sol#L472-L507

```solidity
    function bucketTake(
        AuctionsState storage auctions_,
        mapping(uint256 => Bucket) storage buckets_,
        DepositsState storage deposits_,
        LoansState storage loans_,
        PoolState memory poolState_,
        address borrowerAddress_,
        bool    depositTake_,
        uint256 index_,
        uint256 collateralScale_
    ) external returns (BucketTakeResult memory result_) {
        Borrower memory borrower = loans_.borrowers[borrowerAddress_];

        if (borrower.collateral == 0) revert InsufficientCollateral(); // revert if borrower's collateral is 0

        (
            result_.collateralAmount,
            result_.t0RepayAmount,
            borrower.t0Debt,
            result_.t0DebtPenalty 
        ) = _takeBucket(
            auctions_,
            buckets_,
            deposits_,
            BucketTakeParams({
                borrower:        borrowerAddress_,
                collateral:      borrower.collateral,
                t0Debt:          borrower.t0Debt,
                inflator:        poolState_.inflator,
                depositTake:     depositTake_,
                index:           index_,
                collateralScale: collateralScale_
            })
        );

        borrower.collateral -= result_.collateralAmount;
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

One way is to revert such take attempts:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-ajna/blob/main/contracts/src/libraries/external/Auctions.sol#L887-L899

```solidity
        if (params_.poolType == uint8(PoolType.ERC721)) {
            // slither-disable-next-line divide-before-multiply
            uint256 collateralTaken = (vars.collateralAmount / 1e18) * 1e18; // solidity rounds down, so if 2.5 it will be 2.5 / 1 = 2

-           if (collateralTaken != vars.collateralAmount && params_.collateral >= collateralTaken + 1e18) { // collateral taken not a round number
+           if (collateralTaken != vars.collateralAmount) { // collateral taken not a round number
+               if (params_.collateral >= collateralTaken + 1e18) {
                    collateralTaken += 1e18; // round up collateral to take
                    // taker should send additional quote tokens to cover difference between collateral needed to be taken and rounded collateral, at auction price
                    // borrower will get quote tokens for the difference between rounded collateral and collateral taken to cover debt
                    vars.excessQuoteToken = Maths.wmul(collateralTaken - vars.collateralAmount, vars.auctionPrice);
+                   vars.collateralAmount = collateralTaken;
+               } else {
+                   revert collateralRoundingIsNeededButNotPossible();        
+               }
            }

-           vars.collateralAmount = collateralTaken;
        }
```

A drawback is that, while the taker can repeat the call with `1` collateral and succeed with it, the `0.9` part will be untakeable. It looks to be a natural limitation of using ERC721 collaterals. From this point some borrower collateral pooling mechanics can be accessed similar to the existing bucket's fractional collateral pooling logic.
