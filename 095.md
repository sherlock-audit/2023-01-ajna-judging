# Number of loans used to to enforce check of dust loan is incorrect

## Summary
From Section 5.5 of the Ajna whitepaper, we note

```text
This minimum is designed to deter dust loans, which have the potential to diminish user experience. This check is enforced only when the number of loans exceeds 10 (*including* the new loan).
```

However, in the current implementation, the check is done on the number of loans *excluding* the new loan.

## Vulnerability Detail

When a user draws debt with `drawDebt()`, `revertOnMinDebt()` is called on the current `loans_`. 

> `_revertOnMinDebt(loans_, result_.poolDebt, vars.borrowerDebt, poolState_.quoteDustLimit)`

This checks if number of loans exceeds 10, if so we make sure that it is less than `_minDebtAmount()`, otherwise check that it is less than `quoteDust` as seen in the code snippet below.

```solidity
function _revertOnMinDebt(
	LoansState storage loans_,
	uint256 poolDebt_,
	uint256 borrowerDebt_,
	uint256 quoteDust_
) view {
	if (borrowerDebt_ != 0) {
		uint256 loansCount = Loans.noOfLoans(loans_);
		if (loansCount >= 10) {
			if (borrowerDebt_ < _minDebtAmount(poolDebt_, loansCount)) revert AmountLTMinDebt();
		} else {
			if (borrowerDebt_ < quoteDust_)                            revert DustAmountNotExceeded();
		}
	}
}
```

The number of loan count is only updated at the end of `drawDebt()` in `Loans.update()`. Hence, if current number of loan = 9, we should include the new loan we are taking, and check with `_minDebtAmount()` instead of `quoteDust()`(which is what the current implementation would be doing).

## Impact
The current implementation does not reflect what the white paper says. One additional loan can be taken before `_minDebtAmount()` is checked against when a user takes debt.
