# Borrower can never fully repay debt due to `_revertOnMinDebt()`

## Summary
`_revertOnMinDebt()` is used to ensure that the total debt a borrower is holding is more than the minimum enforced when borrower draws debt. However, this check is done in `repayDebt()` as well. This will prevent borrower from paying back the debt below the minimum amount enforced.

## Vulnerability Detail
In `repayDebt()`, pool debt and borrower's debt is subtracted based on how much quote token borrower repays as seen in the code snippet below.

```solidity
result_.poolDebt -= result_.quoteTokenToRepay;
vars.borrowerDebt -= result_.quoteTokenToRepay;

// check that paying the loan doesn't leave borrower debt under min debt amount
_revertOnMinDebt(loans_, result_.poolDebt, vars.borrowerDebt, poolState_.quoteDustLimit);
```

The remaining debt amount `vars.borrowerDebt` is then being checked with `revertOnMinDebt()`. `revertOnMinDebt()` enforces that the debt amount must be above the certain amount. This will prevent borrower to fully repay their debt, or to repay it below a certain amount.

## Impact
The `revertOnMinDebt()` seems to be used wrongly here. It will prevent borrowers from paying back their debt fully.
