# Two addresses token can bypass the unique pool token check

## Summary
In `ERC20PoolFactory` and `ERC721PoolFactory`,  any user can deploy pool with a unique pair of collateral and quote. However, two addresses token can bypass this and use the same quote and collateral token pair twice for two addresses token.

## Vulnerability Detail
In `ERC20PoolFactory`, `deployPool` is used for pool creators to deploy a pool with a unique pair of collateral and quote. The check is done in the `canDeploy` modifier.
```solidity
    function deployPool(
        address collateral_, address quote_, uint256 interestRate_
    ) external canDeploy(ERC20_NON_SUBSET_HASH, collateral_, quote_, interestRate_) returns (address pool_) {
        uint256 quoteTokenScale = 10 ** (18 - IERC20Token(quote_).decimals());
        uint256 collateralScale = 10 ** (18 - IERC20Token(collateral_).decimals());


        bytes memory data = abi.encodePacked(
            PoolType.ERC20,
            ajna,
            collateral_,
            quote_,
            quoteTokenScale,
            collateralScale
        );


        ERC20Pool pool = ERC20Pool(address(implementation).clone(data));


        pool_ = address(pool);


        // Track the newly deployed pool
        deployedPools[ERC20_NON_SUBSET_HASH][collateral_][quote_] = pool_;
        deployedPoolsList.push(pool_);


        emit PoolCreated(pool_);


        pool.initialize(interestRate_);
    }
}
```
```solidity
    modifier canDeploy(bytes32 subsetHash_, address collateral_, address quote_, uint256 interestRate_) {
        if (collateral_ == address(0) || quote_ == address(0))              revert IPoolFactory.DeployWithZeroAddress();
        if (deployedPools[subsetHash_][collateral_][quote_] != address(0)) revert IPoolFactory.PoolAlreadyExists();
        if (MIN_RATE >= interestRate_ || interestRate_ >= MAX_RATE)         revert IPoolFactory.PoolInterestRateInvalid();
        _;
    }
```
A two addresses token can bypass the PoolAlreadyExists check and create another pool with the same token as the collateral or quote.

## Impact
Protocol enforces unique collateral and quote pair to prevent confusion and multiple duplicates, which can degrade user experience.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Maybe it is a necessary trade off so that it can be permisionless and does not require whitelisting of tokens. However, I do think that taking note of this is important as any assumption made based on the pool being a unique collateral and quote pair must be taken care off as now two pools can share the same collateral and quote token.
