# Use safeMath from OZ instead of a custome one

## Summary
Several contracts using custom Math library. 

## Vulnerability Detail
In future custom made libraries can cause problems in calculations. Also it can bring less trust from customers if they will see a library that is not verified by a popular company.

## Impact
Harder to update. Less trust from clients.
