# user cannot memorialize too many buckets to a single token with a single call

## Summary
User cannot memorialize too many buckets to a single token with a single call of `memorializePositions` due to a for loop that can exceed block gas limit in the event `indexesLength` gets too big.

## Vulnerability Detail

Before memorialize, which means to take the lp balance of caller and transfer it into a nft token, a user have to mint a token that is linked to the particular pool that he wants the lp balance to be memorialized.
```solidity

    function mint(
        MintParams calldata params_
    ) external override returns (uint256 tokenId_) {
        tokenId_ = _nextId++;

        // revert if the address is not a valid Ajna pool
        if (!_isAjnaPool(params_.pool, params_.poolSubsetHash)) revert NotAjnaPool();

        // record which pool the tokenId was minted in
        poolKey[tokenId_] = params_.pool;

        emit Mint(params_.recipient, params_.pool, tokenId_);

        _safeMint(params_.recipient, tokenId_);
    }
```

As you can see, `for (uint256 i = 0; i < indexesLength; )`, will run through all bucket indexes that the user wants to transfer the lp balance into the token. If the user has many buckets that he/she wants to memorialize, block gas limit will be exceeded and hence causes a revert. User is left with the option of calling `memorializePositions` multiple times with smaller number of buckets. 

```solidity
    function memorializePositions(
        MemorializePositionsParams calldata params_
    ) external override {
        EnumerableSet.UintSet storage positionIndex = positionIndexes[params_.tokenId];

        IPool pool = IPool(poolKey[params_.tokenId]);

        address owner = ownerOf(params_.tokenId);

        uint256 indexesLength = params_.indexes.length;

        for (uint256 i = 0; i < indexesLength; ) {

            // record bucket index at which a position has added liquidity
            // slither-disable-next-line unused-return
            positionIndex.add(params_.indexes[i]);

            (uint256 lpBalance,) = pool.lenderInfo(params_.indexes[i], owner);

            // update token position LPs
            positionLPs[params_.tokenId][params_.indexes[i]] += lpBalance;

            unchecked { ++i; }
        }

        emit MemorializePosition(owner, params_.tokenId);

        // update pool lp token accounting and transfer ownership of lp tokens to PositionManager contract
        pool.transferLPs(owner, address(this), params_.indexes);
    }

```
## Impact
User cannot memorialize too many buckets to the token with a single call.
