# Amount of 0 can be moved even though protocol enforces that amount moved must exceed `quoteDustLimit`

## Summary
An input of 0 is accepted when we call `moveQuoteToken()` even though we do not want dust amount to be moved.

## Vulnerability Detail
In `moveQuoteToken()`, in the following code snippet,

```solidity
if (params_.maxAmountToMove != 0 && params_.maxAmountToMove < poolState_.quoteDustLimit)
     revert DustAmountNotExceeded();
```

We see that if `params.maxAmountToMove == 0`, function can still be called due to the && operator.

## Impact
An amount of 0 that can be moved can lead to unexpected outcomes as we are preventing the move of dust amount, and can lead to confusion.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider removing the `params_.maxAmountToMove != 0` check and thus allowing only values >= poolState_.quoteDustLimit to be moved.
