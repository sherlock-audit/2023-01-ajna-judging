# Insufficient access validation in core functions

## Summary

Insufficient access validation in core functions

## Vulnerability Detail

Core functions, like creating, voting and executing proposals, in both contracts ExtraordinaryFunding.sol and StandartFunding.sol can be called and impelemted by any user. Eventhough only token owner users' votes can be counted it's still be cause problems in future. 

## Impact

A malicious users can create a proposal with a inactive address in calldata with transfer function. If this proposal will be implemented some user tokens will be blocked. Moreover that user can propose and transfer token to his another account and get a great voting power.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

I would recommend to add checks for core functions if a user has Ajna token prior to any actions. In a second case a whilte list can be created for trusted users.
