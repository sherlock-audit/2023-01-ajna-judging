# There is no validation to check whether or not the `first one hour is elapsed`, which results in that a borrower will lose their `"cure period"`  to recapitalize their loan

## Summary
There is no validation to check whether or not the first one hour is elapsed, which results in that anyone can start auction soon after liquidation (the `kick()` function is called) and therefore a borrower will lose their `"cure period"` to recapitalize their loan.

## Vulnerability Detail
According to [Ajna Technical Spec](https://docsend.com/view/ai74yqgzjp3yydyt), when the `take()` function and `bucketTake()` function can be called is explained like below:
> - The first hour after the loan has been sent to liquidation is a “cure period” in which the loan can be recapitalized and no take, arbTake or depositTake can be called on the auction.
> - After one hour, the take() and bucketTake() methods can be called by anyone to buy collateral from the loan at an auction price determined by the system.

Based on explanation above, the both functions `take()` and `bucketTake()` can be called by `anyone` _**after** the `first one hour` is elapsed_.

However, There is no validation to check whether or not the `first one hour` is elapsed in the both methods `take()` and `bucketTake()` . 

As a result, anyone can start auction soon after liquidation (the `kick()` function is called) and therefore a borrower will lose their `"cure period"` to recapitalize their loan.


## Impact
A borrower will lose their `"cure period"` to recapitalize their loan.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider adding a validation for checking whether or not the first one hour is elapsed like below to the both methods `take()` and `bucketTake()` . 
```solidity
/// NOTE：In advance, the timestamp when the kick() function was called should be assigned into "LIQUDATION_TIME" below.

if (block.timestamp - LIQUDATION_TIME < 1 hour)  {
    revert CurePeriodIsNotElapsed();
}
```
