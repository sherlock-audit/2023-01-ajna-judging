# Missing nonreentrant check in Position Manager mint function

## Summary

The mint function for poisition NFTs uses _safemint which can enable reentrancy

## Vulnerability Detail

The _safeMint function from Openzepplin's ERC721 contract includes a callback to the receiver of the NFT through the onERC721Recived handle
If the receiver is a contract, it can take control of execution and mint multiple NFTs for the same position since the mint function here is not marked nonreentrant

## Impact

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It is advised to always use a reentrancy guard when calling safemint function. So mark the mint function at L#181 as nonreentrant
