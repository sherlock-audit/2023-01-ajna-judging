# BurnWrapper.sol revert when user wants to withdraw the AJNA token, result in loss of voting power

## Summary

BurnWrapper revert when user wants to withdraw the AJNA token, result in loss of voting power

## Vulnerability Detail

According to

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-ajna/blob/main/ecosystem-coordination/MULTICHAIN_STRATEGY.md#sidechains

> Due to the lower safety of sidechain bridges, Ajna tokens must first be wrapped in the BurnWrapper.sol contract. The BurnWrapper contract enables L1 Ajna tokens to be wrapped via OpenZeppelin's ERC20Wrapper extension, and converted into BurnWrapped tokens. Tokens wrapped this way cannot be unwrapped. Pools in the sidechains will point to the sidechain token address created by mapping the BurnWrapped tokens to the sidechain token. Each sidechain will have it's own BurnWrapper instance. This design prevents double-spends due to sidechain bridges being compromised and releasing L1 tokens incorrectly, artifically increasing the token supply available for burn-and-buy.

Now let us look into the implementation of the BurnWrappedAjna:

```solidity
contract BurnWrappedAjna is ERC20, ERC20Burnable, ERC20Permit, ERC20Wrapper {
```

which inherits from ERC20Wrapper.sol

The implementation of the ERC20Wrapper.sol is short and sweet:

https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/b1c2c43d6af6adf0b0a74cc77683b1d13d66e8bc/contracts/token/ERC20/extensions/ERC20Wrapper.sol#L18

```solidity
abstract contract ERC20Wrapper is ERC20 {
    IERC20 public immutable underlying;

    constructor(IERC20 underlyingToken) {
        underlying = underlyingToken;
    }

    /**
     * @dev See {ERC20-decimals}.
     */
    function decimals() public view virtual override returns (uint8) {
        try IERC20Metadata(address(underlying)).decimals() returns (uint8 value) {
            return value;
        } catch {
            return super.decimals();
        }
    }

    /**
     * @dev Allow a user to deposit underlying tokens and mint the corresponding number of wrapped tokens.
     */
    function depositFor(address account, uint256 amount) public virtual returns (bool) {
        SafeERC20.safeTransferFrom(underlying, _msgSender(), address(this), amount);
        _mint(account, amount);
        return true;
    }

    /**
     * @dev Allow a user to burn a number of wrapped tokens and withdraw the corresponding number of underlying tokens.
     */
    function withdrawTo(address account, uint256 amount) public virtual returns (bool) {
        _burn(_msgSender(), amount);
        SafeERC20.safeTransfer(underlying, account, amount);
        return true;
    }

    /**
     * @dev Mint wrapped token to cover any underlyingTokens that would have been transferred by mistake. Internal
     * function that can be exposed with access control if desired.
     */
    function _recover(address account) internal virtual returns (uint256) {
        uint256 value = underlying.balanceOf(address(this)) - totalSupply();
        _mint(account, value);
        return value;
    }
}
```

However, in the current implementation of BurnWrapper, the withdrawTo is disabled, as described in the mark down read me file:

```solidity
/**
 * @notice Override unwrap method to ensure burn wrapped tokens can't be unwrapped.
 */
function withdrawTo(address, uint256) public pure override returns (bool) {
	revert UnwrapNotAllowed();
}
```

Basically if user calls depositFor and use AJNA in exchange for BurnedWrapped AJNA token, his AJNA is burned and lost.

## Impact

The issue is that only AJNA can be used to vote for governance,

AJNA token inherits from ERC20Votes, but the wrapped AJNA does not

```solidity
contract AjnaToken is ERC20, ERC20Burnable, ERC20Permit, ERC20Votes {
```

the Burned Wrapped AJNA is tradeable but cannot vote for governance.

This can be a issue over time: 

AJNA token becomes less and less. and burned wrapped token becomes more and more, some part of the wrapped token is cross-chained to other L2 chain or side chain.

However, the loss of AJNA means the lost of voting power because the voting can only be done in AJNA.

According to the white paper:

> 9.2.2 Extraordinary Funding Mechanism (EFM)

> If 51% of non-treasury tokens vote affirmatively for a proposal, up to 1% of the
treasury may be withdrawn by the proposal

> If 65% of non-treasury tokens vote affirmatively for a proposal, up to 15% of the
treasury may be withdrawn by the proposal

However, if 50% of the AJNA token is locked in BurnWrapper and while 10% of the wrapped AJNA token is not in ethereum blockchain, the threshold 50% can never be reached, which breaks the Extraordinary Funding Mechanism.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

We recommend the protocol enable the withdrawTo function for BurnWrapper or at least let BurnWrapper inherit from ERC20Vote contract so the wrapped AJNA token can be used to vote.

```solidity
import { ERC20Votes }    from "@oz/token/ERC20/extensions/ERC20Votes.sol";
```
