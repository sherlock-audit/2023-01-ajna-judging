# Deposits that happens in the same block as when a bucket goes bankrupt are all lost

## Summary
When we `addQuoteToken()` or `moveQuoteToken()`, the `if (bankruptcyTime == block.timestamp) revert BucketBankruptcyBlock()` check is done to prevent depositing into a bucket when bankruptcy happens. However, it is still possible for tokens to be added to a bucket in the same block BEFORE the bankruptcy happens in the same block.

Any deposits that are made in this block will be lost for the depositor.

## Vulnerability Detail
We first note that deposits are often checked this way to determine if lender has any lps. Deposits that are made before or equal to the bankruptcy time are not included as they are "bankrupted".

> `if (bucket.bankruptcyTime < lender.depositTime) vars.lenderLPs = lender.lps`

This highlights the importance of the following check.

> `if (bankruptcyTime == block.timestamp) revert BucketBankruptcyBlock()`

We want to prevent users from depositing when a bucket is bankrupt. However, the evm contains transactions and can only be executed in order. If we have multiple transactions from this protocol, with some `addQuoteToken()` transactions happening before the transaction that causes a bucket to go bankrupt, adding quote token will still succeed and happens at the same `block.timestamp` as `bankruptcyTime`.

This means deposits that are made at this time will all be removed as they are considered to be deposited before bankruptcy happens. Users should not be punished in this way.

## Impact
Users who deposit quote tokens when bankruptcy happens will immediately lose all their assets. Their lp portion of the bucket will be 0.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
In the current iteration of the protocol, the issue we ultmately want to solve here is that in the block where a bankruptcy happens, no deposits should be made. I am not sure if there is a way to prevent this. 

What we can however, do to prevent this issue is to allow deposits to happen when a bucket is bankrupt, and consider such deposits to be unaffected by the bankruptcy.
