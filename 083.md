# `moveQuoteToken()` can cause bucket to go bankrupt but it is not reflected in the accounting

## Summary
Both `removeQuoteToken()` and `moveQuoteToken()` can be used to completely remove all quote tokens from a bucket. When this happens, if at the same time `bucketCollateral == 0 && lpsRemaining != 0`, then the bucket should be declared bankrupt. This update is done in `removeQuoteToken()` but not in `moveQuoteToken()`.

## Vulnerability Detail
`removeQuoteToken()` has the following check to update bankruptcy time when collateral and quote token remaining is 0, but lps is more than 0. `moveQuoteToken()` is however missing this check. Both this functions has the same effects on the `fromBucket` and the only difference is that `removeQuoteToken()` returns the token to `msg.sender` but `moveQuoteToken()` moves the token to another bucket.

```solidity
if (removeParams.bucketCollateral == 0 && unscaledRemaining == 0 && lpsRemaining != 0) {
	emit BucketBankruptcy(params_.index, lpsRemaining);
	bucket.lps            = 0;
	bucket.bankruptcyTime = block.timestamp;
} else {
	bucket.lps = lpsRemaining;
}
```

## Impact
A future depositor to the bucket will get less lps than expected due to depositing in a bucket that is supposedly bankrupt, hence the lps they get will be diluted with the existing ones in the bucket.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
We should check if a bucket is bankrupt after moving quote tokens.
