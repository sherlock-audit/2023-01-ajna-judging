# Lack of access control for PositionManager.sol#memorializePositions

## Summary

Lack of access control for PositionManager.sol#memorializePositions

## Vulnerability Detail

In the current implementation of the PositionManager.sol#memoralizePositions,

the code is shown below:

```solidity
function memorializePositions(
	MemorializePositionsParams calldata params_
) external override {
	EnumerableSet.UintSet storage positionIndex = positionIndexes[params_.tokenId];

	IPool pool = IPool(poolKey[params_.tokenId]);

	address owner = ownerOf(params_.tokenId);

	uint256 indexesLength = params_.indexes.length;

	for (uint256 i = 0; i < indexesLength; ) {

		// record bucket index at which a position has added liquidity
		// slither-disable-next-line unused-return
		positionIndex.add(params_.indexes[i]);

		(uint256 lpBalance,) = pool.lenderInfo(params_.indexes[i], owner);

		// update token position LPs
		positionLPs[params_.tokenId][params_.indexes[i]] += lpBalance;

		unchecked { ++i; }
	}

	emit MemorializePosition(owner, params_.tokenId);

	// update pool lp token accounting and transfer ownership of lp tokens to PositionManager contract
	pool.transferLPs(owner, address(this), params_.indexes);
}
```

the code memorize the position of the ownerOf(params_.tokenid) and transfer the position to the PositionManager.sol

```solidity
pool.transferLPs(owner, address(this), params_.indexes);
```

but the code never verify if the caller of the function is the owner of the params token id or an approved opereator for the params token id.

## Impact

Consider the case below,

The owner wants to mint an NFT, and he call Pool#approveLpOwnership before to approve the PositionManager.sol transfer the position so the code below does not revert.

```solidity
pool.transferLPs(owner, address(this), params_.indexes);
```

He recogize his position at index busket is not optimized and he wants to add more liquidity or adjust his position. He does not want to lock his position yet.

But someone or anyone can step in and call memorializePosition for the owner of the NFT, and the meorialized Position is not the most optimal position that the owner wants.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

We recommend the protocol validate the msg.sender that calls memorializePositions is the owner of the NFT or an approved operator for the NFT.
