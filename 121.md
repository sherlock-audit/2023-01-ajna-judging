# Calculating new rewards is susceptible to precision loss due to division before multiplication

## Summary

Rewards may be lost (0) due to division before multiplication precision issues.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `RewardsManager._calculateNewRewards` function calculates the new rewards for a staker by first dividing `interestEarned_` by `totalInterestEarnedInPeriod` and then multiplying by `totalBurnedInPeriod`. If `interestEarned_` is small enough and `totalInterestEarnedInPeriod` is large enough, the division may result in a value of 0, resulting in the staker receiving 0 rewards.

## Impact

Stakers may not receive rewards due to precision loss.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
408: function _calculateNewRewards(
409:     address ajnaPool_,
410:     uint256 interestEarned_,
411:     uint256 nextEpoch_,
412:     uint256 epoch_,
413:     uint256 rewardsClaimedInEpoch_
414: ) internal view returns (uint256 newRewards_) {
415:     (
416:         ,
417:         // total interest accumulated by the pool over the claim period
418:         uint256 totalBurnedInPeriod,
419:         // total tokens burned over the claim period
420:         uint256 totalInterestEarnedInPeriod
421:     ) = _getPoolAccumulators(ajnaPool_, nextEpoch_, epoch_);
422:
423:     // calculate rewards earned
424:     newRewards_ = Maths.wmul(
425:         REWARD_FACTOR,
426:         Maths.wmul(
427:             Maths.wdiv(interestEarned_, totalInterestEarnedInPeriod), totalBurnedInPeriod
428:         )
429:     );
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider calculating the new rewards by first multiplying `interestEarned_` by `totalBurnedInPeriod` and then dividing by `totalInterestEarnedInPeriod` to avoid precision loss.
