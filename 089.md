# A bucket can go bankrupt without the bankruptcy time being updated

## Summary
When `bucketCollateral == 0 && bucketDeposit == 0 && bucketLPs != 0`, the bucket should be declared bankrupt, and `bucket.lps` set to 0, however, this is not check upon in `removeCollateral()`.

## Vulnerability Detail
`removeCollateral()` can be used to remove all collaterals from a bucket. This is used for ERC721 pools. On the other hand, `removeMaxCollateral()` is used for ERC20 pools and can also be used to remove all collaterals from a bucket.

In `removeMaxCollateral()`, a check is done to ensure that bucket is not bankrupt after removal is done. Otherwise, `bucket.bankruptcyTime` is set to 0 and all lps of the bucket is removed. We can see in the below code snippet.

[LenderAction.sol#L623-L629](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-ajna/blob/main/contracts/src/libraries/external/LenderActions.sol#L623-L629)
```solidity
if (bucketCollateral == 0 && bucketDeposit == 0 && bucketLPs != 0) {
    emit BucketBankruptcy(index_, bucketLPs);
    bucket.lps            = 0;
    bucket.bankruptcyTime = block.timestamp;
} else {
    bucket.lps = bucketLPs;
}
```

However, in `removeCollateral()`, this check is not done. `bucket.lps` and `bucket.collateral` is updated immediately based on removed amount. After this update, `bucket.collateral` can be 0 but `bucket.lps` more than 0.

[LenderAction.sol#L411-L413](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-ajna/blob/main/contracts/src/libraries/external/LenderActions.sol#L411-L413)
```solidity
// update bucket LPs and collateral balance
bucket.lps        -= Maths.min(bucketLPs, lpAmount_);
bucket.collateral -= Maths.min(bucketCollateral, amount_);
```

## Impact
Future depositors to this bucket will get less `lps` than expected, as the bucket does not have collateral or deposit(hence supposedly bankrupt), but yet still have existing lps in it.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
We should do the same check in `removeCollateral()` like how it is done in `_removeMaxCollateral()`.
