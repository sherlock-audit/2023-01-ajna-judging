# Memorializing an NFT position on the same bucket of a previously memorialized NFT locks redemption

## Summary

Memorializing a position as an NFT on the same bucket of an existing memorialized position will not allow any of the owners to directly redeem it back later.

## Vulnerability Detail

This issue happens because, after a position is memorialized on the `PositionManager`, this contract will centralize LP positions from different users, but these will be mapped to the same address from the point of view of Ajna pools (different users will be mapped as the same `lender` from the point of view of a `Pool`). 

If more than one user has memorialized a position to the same bucket index, when attempting to `PositionManager.redeemPositions`, the call to [`pool.transferLPs`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-ajna/blob/main/contracts/src/PositionManager.sol#L311) will revert with [`NoAllowance`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-ajna/blob/main/contracts/src/libraries/external/LenderActions.sol#L538), as `LenderActions` does not allow a transfer with value lower than the total `lenderLpBalance`.

Because of that, any of the users' that share a bucket `redeemPositions` calls will fail.

## Impact

Although users that share a bucket with memorialized positions are not able to direct redeem their positions, they can eventually get their LPs back with a specific set of actions.

By first calling `PositionManager.moveLiquidity` to a bucket _without any other LPs_ managed by `PositionsManager` (since `LenderActions.moveQuoteToken` accepts moving less liquidity than the total a LP balance for a specific bucket), and then calling `PositionManager.redeemPositions`, LP-ers will be able to redeem their positions back. Because of this possibility, this is a Medium-severity issue.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

There are some possible alternatives to solving this issue.

1. Allow `LenderActions.transferLPs` to transfer an amount different than the total LP balance. Appropriate care must be taken with [`approve/transfer` attack vectors](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YLPtQxZu1UAvO9cZ1O2RPXBbT0mooh4DYKjA_jp-RLM/edit#), that do not exist now as approvals are always exact and cleared after every transfer, but they may become important if the this flow is refactored.
2. Reconsider the `PositionsManager` architecture and the way the LP balances are stored on the Ajna protocol. Since positions are not tokenized by default, but instead are stored on state variables on each pool, it is arguably more complex to reason about transferring positions between two users. Conversely, the ERC-20 and ERC-721 standards already provide straightforward methods for minting/burning/sending tokens for accounts. A suggestion is, for example, to remove the optionality of NFT minting through another independent contract (the `PositionManager.sol`), and instead to refactor the Ajna pools so that every position is an ERC-721 NFT minted directly by the `Pool.sol`.
