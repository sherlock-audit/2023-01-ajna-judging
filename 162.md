# ERC721Pool taker callback misreports quote funds whenever there was collateral amount rounding

## Summary

atomicSwapCallback() now reports `tokensTaken` higher than one corresponding to `quoteTokenAmount` whenever the rounding took place as the `excessQuoteToken` is omitted.

## Vulnerability Detail

ERC721Pool's take() `atomicSwapCallback` needs to have full quote amount, `(result.quoteTokenAmount + result.excessQuoteToken)`, when there is a quote token part added to have the whole integer amount of the collateral asset.

Now the callback quote value, `quoteTokenAmount`, is inconsistent with the collateral amount `tokensTaken` when there was rounding.

## Impact

The impact depends on the logic on `callee_` side, but asset amounts are usually used in the downstream asset management logic, so misreporting such amounts can lead to the asset losses on the taker's side.

As that's the precondition, setting the severity to be medium.

## Code Snippet

ERC721Pool's take() reports `result.quoteTokenAmount` and `tokensTaken` as take result to the `callee_`, ignoring collateral rounding part:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-ajna/blob/main/contracts/src/ERC721Pool.sol#L452-L463

```solidity
        if (data_.length != 0) {
            IERC721Taker(callee_).atomicSwapCallback(
                tokensTaken,
                result.quoteTokenAmount / _getArgUint256(QUOTE_SCALE), 
                data_
            );
        }

        if (result.settledAuction) _rebalanceTokens(borrowerAddress_, result.remainingCollateral);

        // transfer from taker to pool the amount of quote tokens needed to cover collateral auctioned (including excess for rounded collateral)
        _transferQuoteTokenFrom(callee_, result.quoteTokenAmount + result.excessQuoteToken);
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider adding the `excessQuoteToken` to the reported value:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-ajna/blob/main/contracts/src/ERC721Pool.sol#L452-L463

```solidity
        if (data_.length != 0) {
            IERC721Taker(callee_).atomicSwapCallback(
                tokensTaken,
-               result.quoteTokenAmount / _getArgUint256(QUOTE_SCALE), 
+               (result.quoteTokenAmount + result.excessQuoteToken) / _getArgUint256(QUOTE_SCALE), 
                data_
            );
        }

        if (result.settledAuction) _rebalanceTokens(borrowerAddress_, result.remainingCollateral);

        // transfer from taker to pool the amount of quote tokens needed to cover collateral auctioned (including excess for rounded collateral)
        _transferQuoteTokenFrom(callee_, result.quoteTokenAmount + result.excessQuoteToken);
```
