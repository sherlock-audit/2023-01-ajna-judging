# Increasing and decreasing interest rates are not reciprocal

## Summary

Whenever interest rates should be increased, they are multiplied by [1.1](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-ajna/blob/main/contracts/src/libraries/external/PoolCommons.sol#L31). Whenever they should be decreased, they are multiplied by [0.9](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-ajna/blob/main/contracts/src/libraries/external/PoolCommons.sol#L32). These values are 10% apart from 100%, in absolute terms, but they are not reciprocal. This means that decreasing interest rates will lead to a lower value than what it should, and an increase followed by a decrease will not achieve the same initial value.

## Vulnerability Detail

Decreasing by 10% is in reality `1/1.1`, which equals `0.9090...` (almost 91%) the initial amount, and not `0.9` (90%).

## Impact

Decreasing interest rates will lead to a lower value than what it should, and an increase followed by a decrease will not achieve the same initial value. 

## Code Snippet

```solidity
        // raise rates if 4*(tu-1.02*mau) < (tu+1.02*mau-1)^2-1
        if (4 * (tu - mau102) < ((tu + mau102 - 1e18) ** 2) / 1e18 - 1e18) {
            newInterestRate = Maths.wmul(poolState_.rate, INCREASE_COEFFICIENT);
        }
        // decrease rates if 4*(tu-mau) > 1-(tu+mau-1)^2
        else if (4 * (tu - mau) > 1e18 - ((tu + mau - 1e18) ** 2) / 1e18) {
            newInterestRate = Maths.wmul(poolState_.rate, DECREASE_COEFFICIENT);
        }
```

## Recommendation

When decreasing interest rates, divide by 1.1 instead of multiplying by 0.9
