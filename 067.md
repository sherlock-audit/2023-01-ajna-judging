# Improper Interface Implementation Check in Pool Functions

## Summary
Vulnerability has been found in some functions, such as lup, hpb, htp, y momp, in a smart contract
These functions do not check if the supplied address is valid or if the IPool interface is implemented on the supplied address
This can cause a runtime exception
## Vulnerability Detail
The issue is that some functions, lup, hpb, htp, y momp, in the smart contract do not verify if the supplied address is valid or if the IPool interface is implemented on the supplied address.
This means that when these functions are called, they may encounter an exception if the supplied address is invalid or if the IPool interface is not implemented.
## Impact
The impact of this vulnerability is that it can cause the smart contract to fail at runtime, potentially resulting in the loss of funds or other unintended behavior.
## Code Snippet
```solidity
function lup(
        address ajnaPool_
    ) external view returns (uint256) {
        IPool pool = IPool(ajnaPool_);

        (uint256 debt,,) = pool.debtInfo();
        uint256 currentLupIndex = pool.depositIndex(debt);

        return _priceAt(currentLupIndex);
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To fix this vulnerability, the smart contract should be modified to check if the supplied address is valid and if the IPool interface is implemented on the supplied address before calling the functions lup, hpb, htp, y momp.
This will ensure that the smart contract does not encounter an exception at runtime and that it behaves as expected.

```solidity
import { SafeMath } from 'openzeppelin-solidity/contracts/math/SafeMath.sol';
...
    using SafeMath for uint256;

    function lup(address ajnaPool_) external view returns (uint256) {
        IPool pool = IPool(ajnaPool_);

        require(pool.isIPool(), "Address does not implement IPool interface");

        (uint256 debt) = pool.debtInfo();
        uint256 currentLupIndex = pool.depositIndex(debt);

        return _priceAt(currentLupIndex);
    }
...
