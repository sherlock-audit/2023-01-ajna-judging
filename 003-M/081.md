# Tokens are assumed to have interest rate quotes of 1e18 decimal places when attempting to deploy a pool.

## Summary
Users might have to may less or more than what they should be paying which may cause unessecary financial gain or loss when tokens have less than 1e18 decimal points. 

## Vulnerability Detail
Source of the issue is that the interest rate has 18 decimal places enforced and hardcoded in the `PoolDeployer.sol` contract. This was a medium in severity because a token such as USDC, USDT or WBTC needs to be used to see the effects of this issue as opposed to WETH or DAI. 

## Impact
This can result in incorrect interest calculations for tokens which don't use `1e18` decimal places.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Recommend setting this during pool deployment while dynamically token decimal places by using the `ERC20(addr).decimals()`function.
