## Vulnerability Detail
To deploy tokens with more than 18 would always revert due to underflow.

## Impact
Tokens with more than 18 decimals would revert and pool cannot be deployed.
## Code Snippet
```sol
uint256 quoteTokenScale = 10 ** (18 - IERC20Token(quote_).decimals());
uint256 collateralScale = 10 ** (18 - IERC20Token(collateral_).decimals());
```
## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Handle cases of token decimal more than 18.
