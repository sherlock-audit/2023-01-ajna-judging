# `ERC20PoolFactory.deployPool` does not support tokens with more than 18 decimals

## Summary

Deploying an Ajna pool through the `ERC20PoolFactory`  factory does not work for tokens with more than 18 decimals.

## Vulnerability Detail

The issue happens because the quote token/collateral scale conversion will revert, as it will [try to decrement](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-ajna/blob/main/contracts/src/ERC20PoolFactory.sol#L53-L54) the token decimals from 18. Notoriously, [`YAMv2` has 24 decimals](https://twitter.com/asvanevik/status/1296137991367413761) and would not be accepted on the `ERC20PoolFactory` contract.

## Impact

ERC-20 tokens with more than 18 decimals cannot have a deployed pool.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
        uint256 quoteTokenScale = 10 ** (18 - IERC20Token(quote_).decimals());
        uint256 collateralScale = 10 ** (18 - IERC20Token(collateral_).decimals());
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Accept more than 18 decimals for the quote token/collateral scales.
