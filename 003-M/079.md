# Small amounts of WBTC or other tokens with less than 1e18 cannot be used in this protocol due to rounding errors

## Summary
The protocol spec states that flagship ERC20 tokens including WBTC are included however, WBTC cannot be deposited unless the user deposits >= 100 WBTC (2.27M USDC at the time of writing). This may limit the potential amount of lenders in the protocol due to the lack of support for flag ship coins. This will also affect taking out flashloans and make these types of loans basically unusable, for instance, if a user intends to take out a 3,000,000 USDT (6 dp - 3  000000) flashloan, only 3 USDT tokens will be flashloaned to the user. 

## Vulnerability Detail
For the following example, consider the WBTC (Wrapped Bitcoin) token. This is mainly due to setting up token scaling incorrectly when when depositing quote tokens (`Pool.sol`:`addQuoteToken()` which calls -> `PoolHelper.sol`:`_roundToScale()`) as the decimal places are not represented as a fixed-point decimal format. For example, the current minimum quote tokens lent when depositing is `100 00000000` WBTC (8 decimal places) in the `addQuoteToken()` function when computing the correct scaling instead of `1 00000000` WBTC. `_roundToScale()` was originally intended to fix an issue in the protocol where a user can increase their LPs by transferring zero tokens to drain the pool however, this function is implemented incorrectly due to a rounding error. 

*Proof of Concept:*
```solidity
    function testLimitedWBTC() public {
        
        // ============== Setup Scenario ==============
        // Deploy Pool
        uint256 interestRateTwo = 0.05 * 10**18; // Standard interest rate as seen in the tests
        address poolThreeAddress = erc20PoolFactory.deployPool(address(dai), address(wbtc), interestRateTwo);  
        
        ERC20Pool poolThree = ERC20Pool(address(poolThreeAddress));
        vm.label(address(poolThree), "Pool Three wbtc / dai");

        vm.startPrank(address(wbtcDoner));
        wbtc.transfer(address(dan), 100 * 1e8); // transfer 100 wbtc = approx 2,250,038 DAI at the time of writing
        vm.stopPrank();

        // =============================================


        // Begin Scenario - dan adds 99 wbtc to the lending pool
        vm.startPrank(address(dan));
        wbtc.approve(address(poolThree), 99 * 1e8);
        poolThree.addQuoteToken(99 * 1e8, 2000); // More or less the same price as btc / dai
        vm.stopPrank();

        assertEq(wbtc.balanceOf(address(dan)), 100* 1e8); // Dan's balance is still the same (100 wbtc) and the program silently fails

		// Dan tries again with 100 wbtc
        vm.startPrank(address(dan));
        wbtc.approve(address(poolThree), 100 * 1e8);
        poolThree.addQuoteToken(100 * 1e8, 2000); 
        vm.stopPrank();

        assertEq(wbtc.balanceOf(address(dan)), 0); // Only gets transferred if 100 btc is supplied
        
    }
```

## Impact
Flagship tokens such as WBTC, USDC, USDT and other tokens which have less than 1e18 decimal places cannot be used which may limit the amount of lending opportunities in this protocol.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
In solidity, it's considered bad practice to perform division before multiplication which can lead to unexpected results. I recommend doing multiplication before division operations when attempting to scale quote tokens. The `_roundToScale()` function can be modified to reflect the following:
```solidity
    function _roundToScale(
        uint256 amount_,
        uint256 tokenScale_
    ) pure returns (uint256 scaledAmount_) {
        scaledAmount_ = (amount_ * tokenScale_) / tokenScale_;
    }
```
