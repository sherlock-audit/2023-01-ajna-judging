# Protocol does not support tokens with less than 18 decimals

## Summary
Updated supported token limitations notes that these tokens are not supported

```text
NFT and fungible tokens which charge a fee on transfer.
Fungible tokens whose balance rebases.
Fungible tokens with more than 18 decimals or 0 decimals.
```

However, tokens that are less than 18 decimals will not work with the protocol as well.

## Vulnerability Detail
The calculation of exchange rate between quote token and collateral assumes that tokens are 18 decimals.

```solidity
function getExchangeRate(
	uint256 bucketCollateral_,
	uint256 bucketLPs_,
	uint256 bucketDeposit_,
	uint256 bucketPrice_
) internal pure returns (uint256) {
	return bucketLPs_ == 0
		? Maths.RAY
		: (bucketDeposit_ * 1e18 + bucketPrice_ * bucketCollateral_) * 1e18 / bucketLPs_;
		// 10^36 * 1e18 / 10^27 = 10^54 / 10^27 = 10^27
}
```

For example, if USDC(6 decimals) is used as `quoteToken` deposited into the bucket, we have,
> `bucketDeposit_ * 1e18 + bucketPrice_ * bucketCollateral_ = 1e6 * 1e18 + 1e18 * 1e18`

Calculation above will be done incorretly. This exchange rate is used to calculate conversion of both `quoteTokensToLPs()` and `collateralToLPs()` and can return a wrong result when tokens that are not 18 decimals.

## Impact
Tokens that are meant to be supported should not be used, but users will not be aware as such as protocol does not explicitly states it.

## Recommendation
If tokens with less than 18 decimals are meant to be supported, we should not assume that tokens are only 18 decimals.
