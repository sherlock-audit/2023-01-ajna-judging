# Excess Minting of tokenIds due to missing reentrancy guard in PositionManager.sol.

## Summary
A malicious user can mint more tokenIds than he is supposed to.

## Vulnerability Detail
The mint() function makes an external call to _safeMint() which contains a callback "_checkOnERC721Received(address(0), **to,** **tokenId**, data)", to the "to" address. 
Mint() function has no reentrancy guard to protect against reentrancy attacks
A malicious user can reenter the mint() function after the initial minting.

## Impact
 A malicious user can mint more tokenIds than he is supposed to, then call stake and unstake functions in RewardsManager.sol and use them to claim rewards. 
He could also use the excess tokenIds to borrow as much NFTs he wants and may choose not to repay. (check drawDebt() in ERC721Pool.sol)

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-ajna/blob/main/contracts/src/PositionManager.sol#L181-L195
```solidity
    function mint(
        MintParams calldata params_
    ) external override returns (uint256 tokenId_) {
        tokenId_ = _nextId++;


        // revert if the address is not a valid Ajna pool
        if (!_isAjnaPool(params_.pool, params_.poolSubsetHash)) revert NotAjnaPool();


        // record which pool the tokenId was minted in
        poolKey[tokenId_] = params_.pool;


        emit Mint(params_.recipient, params_.pool, tokenId_);


        _safeMint(params_.recipient, tokenId_);
    }

```solidity
             function _safeMint(address to, uint256 tokenId, bytes memory data) internal virtual {
        _mint(to, tokenId);
        require(
            _checkOnERC721Received(address(0), to, tokenId, data),
            "ERC721: transfer to non ERC721Receiver implementer"
        );
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add a reentrancy guard on the mint function because Functions with callbacks should have reentrancy guards in place for protection against reentrancy attacks.
