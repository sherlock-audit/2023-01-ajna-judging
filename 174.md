# Vulnerability related to ‘Optimizer Bug Regarding Memory Side Effects of Inline Assembly’

## Summary
Solidity versions 0.8.13 and 0.8.14 are vulnerable to a recently reported  optimizer bug related to inline assembly. Solidity 0.8.15 has been released with a fix. 
https://blog.soliditylang.org/2022/06/15/inline-assembly-memory-side-effects-bug/
## Vulnerability Detail
AutoRoller.sol inherits solidity contracts from solmate FixedPointMathLib and ERC4626 , and both these uses inline assembly, and optimization is enabled while compiling. 
## Impact
This bug only occurs under very specific conditions: the legacy optimizer must be enabled rather than the IR pipeline (true for the current project configuration), and the affected assembly blocks must not refer to any local Solidity variables.
