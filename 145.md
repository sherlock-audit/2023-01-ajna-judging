# Anyone who approved quote tokens to a pool can be forced to take

## Summary
Taking may be executed on behalf of any address who approved spending of quote tokens to a pool: such address will pay quote tokens and will receive collateral.
## Vulnerability Detail
[ERC20Pool](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-ajna/blob/main/contracts/src/ERC20Pool.sol#L403) and [ERC721Pool](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-ajna/blob/main/contracts/src/ERC721Pool.sol#L405) implement the `take` functions, which buy collateral from auction in exchange for quote tokens. The address to pull quote tokens from is specified in the `callee_` argument, which allows anyone to call the functions and pass an address that has previously approved spending of the quote token to the pool. As a result, such an address will pay for the liquidation and will receive the collateral.
## Impact
Anyone can initiate a take on behalf of another user. Such user can be a lender who has previously approved spending of the quote token to the pool. Calling `take` with the user's address specified as the `callee_` argument will result in:
1. the user [receiving collateral](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-ajna/blob/main/contracts/src/ERC20Pool.sol#L450), which may have low value;
1. the user [paying the quote token](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-ajna/blob/main/contracts/src/ERC20Pool.sol#L460) to repay the debt being taken.

## Tool used
Manual Review
## Recommendation
In the `ERC20Pool.take` and `ERC721Pool.take` functions, consider transferring collateral only from `msg.sender`. Alternatively, consider checking that `callee_` has approved spending quote tokens to `msg.sender`.
