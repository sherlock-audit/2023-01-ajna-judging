# Traders/arbitrageurs will incur in early withdrawal penalty when trading collateral for quote token in a single block

## Summary

Traders/arbitrageurs will incur in early withdrawal penalty when attempting to arbitrage pool prices by _Trading collateral for quote token_ in a single block. The opposite, nevertheless, does not incur in any fees, in addition to the pool's interest rates.

## Vulnerability Detail

Traders/arbitrageurs will incur in early withdrawal penalty when attempting to arbitrage pool prices by _Trading collateral for quote token_ at a single block, which might de-incentivize market participants to close external market price gaps. 

The whitepaper states that "This functionality encourages arbitrageurs to take action, keeping deposits in an Ajna pool below external market prices.", but due to a high early withdrawal penalty, this might not always be the case. 

For example, considering an interest rate of 10%, the fee might be as high as 10%/52 = 0.2%

Conversely, trading Quote Tokens for Collateral will not incur in these fees, and can thus be more profitable. 

In order to not incur in early withdrawal fees, bidders must leave collateral for more than 1 day, but this may not be always profitable. 

## Impact

It might not always be profitable for an arbitrageur to close a market price gap by atomically trading collateral for quote token.

## Recommendation

It is advised to remove this penalty for deposit/withdraw in a single block, similarly to how a flashloan does not have fees on Ajna.
