# If borrower or kicker got blacklisted by asset contract their collateral or bond funds can be permanently frozen with the pool

## Summary

It's impossible for borrower or kicker to transfer their otherwise withdraw-able funds to another address. If for some reason borrower or kicker got blacklisted by collateral or quote token contract (correspondingly), these funds will be permanently frozen as now there is no mechanics to move them to another address or specify the recipient for the transfer.

## Vulnerability Detail

If during the duration of a loan the borrower got blacklisted by collateral asset contract, let's say it is USDC, there is no way to retrieve the collateral. These collateral funds will be permanently locked at the Pool contract balance.

Similar, although less dangerous as both duration and exposure is less, situation takes place with kicker's balance, that is referenced by `msg.sender` only and so bonds due will be frozen with the pool if that address be blacklisted.

For lender's case there is a position managing possibility via Pool's transferLPs() and PositionManager's memorializePositions() and reedemPositions(), but for a borrower and a kicker there is no way to transfer funds due ownership or even specify transfer recipient, so the corresponding collateral and bond funds will be frozen with the pool if current beneficiary be blacklisted.

## Impact

Principal funds of borrower or kicker being permanently frozen in full, but backlisting is a low probability event, so setting the severity to be medium.

## Code Snippet

When it is `vars.pull` BorrowerActions's repayDebt() require `borrowerAddress_ == msg.sender`:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-ajna/blob/main/contracts/src/libraries/external/BorrowerActions.sol#L237-L330

```solidity
    function repayDebt(
        AuctionsState storage auctions_,
        mapping(uint256 => Bucket) storage buckets_,
        DepositsState storage deposits_,
        LoansState    storage loans_,
        PoolState calldata poolState_,
        address borrowerAddress_,
        uint256 maxQuoteTokenAmountToRepay_,
        uint256 collateralAmountToPull_
    ) external returns (
        RepayDebtResult memory result_
    ) {
        Borrower memory borrower = loans_.borrowers[borrowerAddress_];

        ...

        if (vars.pull) {
            // only intended recipient can pull collateral
            if (borrowerAddress_ != msg.sender) revert BorrowerNotSender();

            // calculate LUP only if it wasn't calculated by repay action
            if (!vars.repay) result_.newLup = _lup(deposits_, result_.poolDebt);

            uint256 encumberedCollateral = borrower.t0Debt != 0 ? Maths.wdiv(vars.borrowerDebt, result_.newLup) : 0;

            if (borrower.collateral - encumberedCollateral < collateralAmountToPull_) revert InsufficientCollateral();

            // stamp borrower t0Np when pull collateral action
            vars.stampT0Np = true;

            borrower.collateral    -= collateralAmountToPull_;
            result_.poolCollateral -= collateralAmountToPull_;
        }
```

Then funds are being sent in ERC20Pool and ERC721Pool to `msg.sender` with no option to specify another address:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-ajna/blob/main/contracts/src/ERC20Pool.sol#L184-L230

```solidity
    function repayDebt(
        address borrowerAddress_,
        uint256 maxQuoteTokenAmountToRepay_,
        uint256 collateralAmountToPull_
    ) external nonReentrant {
        PoolState memory poolState = _accruePoolInterest();

        ...
        collateralAmountToPull_     = _roundToScale(collateralAmountToPull_,     _bucketCollateralDust(0));

        RepayDebtResult memory result = BorrowerActions.repayDebt(
            ...
        );

        ...
        if (collateralAmountToPull_ != 0) {
            // update pool balances state
            poolBalances.pledgedCollateral = result.poolCollateral;

            // move collateral from pool to sender
            _transferCollateral(msg.sender, collateralAmountToPull_);
        }
    }
```

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-ajna/blob/main/contracts/src/ERC721Pool.sol#L194-L238

```solidity
    function repayDebt(
        address borrowerAddress_,
        uint256 maxQuoteTokenAmountToRepay_,
        uint256 noOfNFTsToPull_
    ) external nonReentrant {
        PoolState memory poolState = _accruePoolInterest();

        RepayDebtResult memory result = BorrowerActions.repayDebt(
            ...
        );

        ...
        if (noOfNFTsToPull_ != 0) {
            // update pool balances state
            poolBalances.pledgedCollateral = result.poolCollateral;

            // move collateral from pool to sender
            _transferFromPoolToAddress(msg.sender, borrowerTokenIds[msg.sender], noOfNFTsToPull_);
        }
    }
```

The same issue takes place in withdrawBonds() as `msg.sender` can be blacklisted in between kicking and withdrawing:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-ajna/blob/main/contracts/src/base/Pool.sol#L318-L327

```solidity
    /**
     *  @inheritdoc IPoolLiquidationActions
     *  @dev write state:
     *       - reset kicker's claimable accumulator
     */
    function withdrawBonds() external {
        uint256 claimable = auctions.kickers[msg.sender].claimable;
        auctions.kickers[msg.sender].claimable = 0;
        _transferQuoteToken(msg.sender, claimable);
    }
```

I.e. if as of time of kicking `msg.sender` wasn't blacklisted, but they were added to blacklist before `auctions.kickers[msg.sender].claimable` were withdrawn, it will be permanently locked on the Pool's balance.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider adding the `recipient` argument to the repayDebt() and withdrawBonds() functions, so the balance beneficiary `msg.sender` can specify what address should receive the funds, for example:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-ajna/blob/main/contracts/src/base/Pool.sol#L318-L327

```solidity
    /**
     *  @inheritdoc IPoolLiquidationActions
     *  @dev write state:
     *       - reset kicker's claimable accumulator
     */
-   function withdrawBonds() external {
+   function withdrawBonds(address recipient) external {
        uint256 claimable = auctions.kickers[msg.sender].claimable;
        auctions.kickers[msg.sender].claimable = 0;
-       _transferQuoteToken(msg.sender, claimable);
+       _transferQuoteToken(recipient, claimable);
    }
```

This will also help for the situation when NFT collateral was put in by a contract borrower without `onERC721Received` implementation, so repayDebt() initiated `_transferNFT() -> safeTransferFrom()` call will fail for `msg.sender` and the ability to use a recipient become crucial.
