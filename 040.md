# The origination fee implementation does not match the white paper specification when borrowers draw debts

## Summary

The origination fee implementation does not match the white paper specification when borrowers draw debts

## Vulnerability Detail

According to the whitepaper,

> When borrowing quote token, a borrower is subject to an origination fee which is immediately
added to their debt. The origination fee is calculated as the greater of the current annualized
borrower interest rate divided by 52 (one week of interest) or 5 bps multiplied by the loanâ€™s debt.

which is:

```solidity
originationFee = max(rate borrow / 52, 0.0005) * debtLoan
```

However, the implementation is:

```solidity
	// borrow against pledged collateral
	// check both values to enable an intentional 0 borrow loan call to update borrower's loan state
	if (amountToBorrow_ != 0 || limitIndex_ != 0) {
		// only intended recipient can borrow quote
		if (borrowerAddress_ != msg.sender) revert BorrowerNotSender();

		// add origination fee to the amount to borrow and add to borrower's debt
		vars.debtChange = Maths.wmul(amountToBorrow_, _feeRate(poolState_.rate) + Maths.WAD);

		vars.borrowerDebt += vars.debtChange;
```

which calls _feeRate function

```solidity
/**
 *  @notice Calculates fee rate for a given interest rate.
 *  @notice Calculated as greater of the current annualized interest rate divided by 52 (one week of interest) or 5 bps.
 *  @param  interestRate_ The current interest rate.
 *  @return Fee rate applied to the given interest rate.
 */
function _feeRate(
	uint256 interestRate_
) pure returns (uint256) {
	// greater of the current annualized interest rate divided by 52 (one week of interest) or 5 bps
	return Maths.max(Maths.wdiv(interestRate_, 52 * 1e18), 0.0005 * 1e18);
}
```

the implementation does not match the white paper specification.

the formula use debt (loan) * max(rate borrow / 52, 0.0005),

**but the code use amountToBorrow instead of the debt loan**

```solidity
vars.debtChange = Maths.wmul(amountToBorrow_, _feeRate(poolState_.rate) + Maths.WAD);

vars.borrowerDebt += vars.debtChange;
```

Also the Math.WAS scalar is added to _feeRate(poolState_.rate), which is not a strict enforce of max(rate borrow / 52, 0.0005) rate.

## Impact

Using amount to borrow instead of the debt loan to calculate the origination fee and not enforcing the origination fee formula will create wrong value of the originatoin fee. the user may overpay the origination fee is the amount to borrow is large or underpay the origniation fee is the amount to borrow is too small when draw new debt.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

We recommend the protocol make sure the implementation of the origination fee matches the white paper strictly.
