# Use of transfer() may lead to failures

## Summary

Use of transfer() may lead to failures in [ERC721Pool.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-ajna/blob/main/contracts/src/ERC721Pool.sol) in the function `_transferFromPoolToAddress`

## Vulnerability Detail

From [EIP-1884](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1884), the use of `transfer()` is no longer advisable since it may lead to failures due to the fact that it has hard coded gas budget and can fail when the user is a smart contract.

## Impact

`transfer()` may lead to failures in the smart contract.

## Code Snippet

[contracts/src/ERC721Pool.sol#L611](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-ajna/blob/main/contracts/src/ERC721Pool.sol#L611)
```Solidity
ICryptoKitties(_getArgAddress(COLLATERAL_ADDRESS)).transfer(toAddress_, tokenId);
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It is suggested to use `call()` instead of `transfer()` without hardcoded gas limits. Also, implements checks-effects-interactions pattern or reentrancy guards for reentrancy protection.
