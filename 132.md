# InterestRate is not calculating correctly


## Summary

Interest Rate is not increased/decreased by every 12 hour consistenly.


## Vulnerability Detail

Everytime the actor takes an action, the pool interest Rate is updated if it's 12 hours after last update.
For example, if borrowing demand is growing and interest rate should increase but there is no action taken to the pool for 3 days, the interestRate can't be increased to deserved value, as well as EMA values.

## Impact

_Wrong interest rate over the pool and incorrect revenue for users_


## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-ajna/blob/main/contracts/src/base/Pool.sol#L481-L489

```solidity
function _updateInterestState(
    PoolState memory poolState_,
    uint256 lup_
) internal {
    // if it has been more than 12 hours since the last interest rate update, call updateInterestRate function
    if (block.timestamp - interestState.interestRateUpdate > 12 hours) {
        PoolCommons.updateInterestRate(interestState, deposits, poolState_, lup_);
    }
```


## Tool used

Manual Review


## Recommendation

Calculate how many 12-hours passed, and multiply/power all scaling values.
