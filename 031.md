# The protocol can mistakenly set EOA account as cryptopunk / crypto-kitty / crypto-fighter collateral address in non-ethereum blockchain

## Summary

The protocol can mistakenly set EOA account as cryptopunk / crypto-kitty / crypto-fighter collateral address in non-ethereum blockchain

## Vulnerability Detail

According to the on-chan context of the protocol, the protocol attempts to support as much as NFT as possible, even non-standard NFT such as crypto punk and crpto punk.

```solidity
DEPLOYMENT: Ethereum mainnet, Arbitrum, Optimism, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, Fantom, Tron, Avalanche
ERC20:  any - ERC20's are used in fungible, collection and subset pool types
ERC721: any - ERC721's are used in collection and subset pool types
ERC777: none
FEE-ON-TRANSFER: none
REBASING TOKENS: none
ADMIN: N/A
```

In the current implementation, the cryptopunk address and CryptoKitties and CryptoFighters address is hardcoded.

```solidity
NFTTypes nftType;
// CryptoPunks NFTs
if (collateral_ == 0xb47e3cd837dDF8e4c57F05d70Ab865de6e193BBB ) {
	nftType = NFTTypes.CRYPTOPUNKS;
}
// CryptoKitties and CryptoFighters NFTs
else if (collateral_ == 0x06012c8cf97BEaD5deAe237070F9587f8E7A266d || collateral_ ==  0x87d598064c736dd0C712D329aFCFAA0Ccc1921A1) {
	nftType = NFTTypes.CRYPTOKITTIES;
}
// All other NFTs that support the EIP721 standard
else {
	// Here 0x80ac58cd is the ERC721 interface Id
	// Neither a standard NFT nor a non-standard supported NFT(punk, kitty or fighter)
	try IERC165(collateral_).supportsInterface(0x80ac58cd) returns (bool supportsERC721Interface) {
		if (!supportsERC721Interface) revert NFTNotSupported();
	} catch {
		revert NFTNotSupported();
	}

	nftType = NFTTypes.STANDARD_ERC721;
}
```

While the hardcoded NFT address is not wrong in ethereum network, given the multi-chain deployment context, if the deployed network is not ethereum, The protocol can mistakenly set EOA account as cryptopunk / crypto-kitty / crypto-fighter collateral address in non-ethereum blockchain.

If we look into the crypto-punk address in multichain

https://blockscan.com/address/0xb47e3cd837dDF8e4c57F05d70Ab865de6e193BBB

While the address is crypto punk NFT in ethereum network. the address is a EOA account in rest of the network.

If we look into the crypto-kitty and crypto-figher address in multichain:

https://blockscan.com/address/0x06012c8cf97BEaD5deAe237070F9587f8E7A266d

and

https://blockscan.com/address/0x87d598064c736dd0C712D329aFCFAA0Ccc1921A1

these address are NFT in the ethereum network but are EOA account in rest of the network.

## Impact

For example, if the deployed network is Polygon or Biinance Smart contract, the deployer set the collateral address to 0xb47e3cd837dDF8e4c57F05d70Ab865de6e193BBB, which is the crypto punk address in ethereum mainnet but it is an EOA account,

In the normal flow, the code below should run to check if the address is a standard NFT.

```solidity
try IERC165(collateral_).supportsInterface(0x80ac58cd) returns (bool supportsERC721Interface) {
	if (!supportsERC721Interface) revert NFTNotSupported();
} catch {
	revert NFTNotSupported();
}
```

However, the code below would executes first and the code wrongly classify the EOA account as the crypto punk address in polygon / BSC network:

```solidity
if (collateral_ == 0xb47e3cd837dDF8e4c57F05d70Ab865de6e193BBB ) {
	nftType = NFTTypes.CRYPTOPUNKS;
}
```

The pool is still created, the borrower is never able to add NFT collateral for quote token.

The lender can mistakenly supply quote token and add liquidity for borrowers in this invalid EOA collateral pool, but the fund will earn no yield because no borrower can add NFT collateral and borrow token out and pay interest to lender.

## Recommendation

We recommend avoid hardcode the NFT address and use a wrapped version smart contract for non-standard NFT.
