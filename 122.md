# Claiming rewards from a future not yet existing epoch prevents claiming rewards for those epochs later on

## Summary

If a user claims rewards for a future epoch, all epochs are marked as claimed up until that future epoch. This prevents the user from claiming rewards for those epochs later, leading to a loss of rewards.

## Vulnerability Detail

Already claimed rewards are tracked in the `isEpochClaimed` mapping and checked in the `RewardsManager.claimRewards` function to prevent claiming rewards multiple times. However, the current implementation does not prevent a user from accidentally claiming rewards for a future epoch. This would iterate through all epochs up until the future epoch and mark them all as claimed. This prevents the user from claiming rewards for those epochs later on, leading to a loss of rewards.

## Impact

If a user accidentally claims rewards for a future epoch, the rewards are lost and unclaimable.

## Recommendation

Consider adding a check to the `RewardsManager.claimRewards` function to prevent claiming rewards for future epochs.
